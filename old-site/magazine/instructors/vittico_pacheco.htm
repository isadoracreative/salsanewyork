        Salsaweb NY on August 1999 - by Manny Siverio) <br>
        <br>
        Vittico Pacheco is a New York Mambo Instructor who teaches out of the Bronx. This
    Dominican started to learn how to dance when he moved to Puerto Rico (82'-86'),
    continued to learn while hanging out at Side Street during its heyday and refined
    his skill when under the guidance of Wilton Beltre who founded the Santo 
        Rico Dance Company (whom he considers his first
    real instructor and mentor). His school (<a href="#class">The Vittico Dance Studio</a>) is located at
        2619
    Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx (not too far away from Jimmy&#146;s Bronx Café).
    A fierce mambo dancer known for his creative turn patterns, the
        <a href="../../guide/Performers/Vittico.htm">Vittico Dance Team</a> has performed in
    almost every major nightclub in the NYC area. He has been a member of such
    performance groups like <a href="../../guide/Performers/SantoRico.htm">The Santo Rico Dance
        Company</a>, The <a href="../../guide/Performers/Descarga.htm">Descarga Latina Dance
    Company</a>, Team New York and The Fuerza Latina Dance Company before moving out on
    his own. As a dancer he has traveled to such places like California, Puerto Rico,
    Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, to his beloved Dominican Republic and has
    participated at events like the 1<sup>st</sup> Annual Congreso Mundial de la Salsa.
        Vittico was also co-founder and co-Director of the Salsa Magic Dance Company
    and his Student Dance Company.
        </font>
        </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">I recently (8/99) visited <a href="#class">Vittico&#146;s
    class</a> in the Bronx. Upon
    arriving at 2619 Sedgwick Avenue, I discovered that it was an apartment building. He
    has been at this present location for 1½ of the four years he has been teaching mambo (as
    of 6/99). I was told to walk down the side entrance alleyway which lead me to the
    building&#146;s basement. Once down there, I followed the sound of salsa music to
    Vittico&#146;s actual Dance School. His school is in reality a decent size storage area which
    had been refurbished into a dance space. It was very clean and &quot;Spartan&quot;
    in
    appearance. The entire room had been freshly painted with white paint for the walls and
    battleship gray for the floor. The space was also equipped with some chairs, a few simple
    mirrors and a sound system. Like I said &quot;Spartan&quot; in appearance. But I use
    the word But I use
    the word<font FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="#ff0000" size="2"> </font></font><font face="Verdana" COLOR="#ff0000" size="2"> &quot;Spartan&quot; </font><font size="2">with the utmost respect. The atmosphere of the school is
    very conducive to work and inspires discipline. People that go to Vittico have a no
    non-sense approach to learning mambo. They go there to work hard, learn from a good
    instructor and not for the esthetic look of the school (and believe me people get their
    money&#146;s worth). I like to think of his students as &quot;mambo gladiators&quot;.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="#class">Vittico&#146;s class</a> is broken down into two groups. The more advance students
    (intermediate level) are taught by Vittico, while the raw beginners are led by one of his
    assistants. The space provides a cement support column which acts as a natural divider
    between the two groups of students. The first half of the class centers on open
    floor shines (solo dancing), while the second half deals with partner work
    (turn patterns). Most of his students speak mainly Spanish, yet all of the shines are
    broken down in English (1,2,3-5,6,7). He leads his group in a very casual manner, yet
    maintains his role as task master. Shines are repeated and repeated until he is happy with
    the overall group performance. Shines are frequently reviewed one-at-a-time,
    back-to-back (one after the other) or in sequence (in combination). I noticed that
    everyone
    is required to count out loud when performing each step. This is Vittico&#146;s way
    of drilling his students. Its an excellent way for to force his students to remember
    how to break down a step (make them second nature), remember where they are in during the
    clave and show them how to get in and out of shine.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the turn pattern segment, Vittico again leads by counting out loud (the others
    count along with him), only stopping to give important pointers during key moments of the
    turn. He drills the hell out of a turn pattern to make sure that students get it. Students
    are rotated from partner to partner so that everyone can get a chance to work everyone
    else. When a 2<sup>nd</sup> pattern is taught, it normally is designed to flow right after
    the first patten. This way, the more advanced students are challenged with a larger
    combination, while the lesser advanced students can still practice the material taught to
    them as two separate turn patterns. You can tell that Vittico&#146;s students are into his
    turns because they can seen practicing them very enthusiastically after class.</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Vittico's Style in a nutshell:</font></b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#800000"><br>
    If I were to compare Vittico Pacheco&#146;s style of mambo dancing to other
    instructors, I would say that he as a very energetic and creative Bronx Street Style of
    dancing; filled with unexpected turns, multiple spins, hand changes, counter spins and
    sometimes even unique arm movements. If you catch him on the dance floor, you can almost
    see the gears turning in his head as he begins to mess around with an idea of a turn
    pattern. You can watch him test and discard ideas until he produces something that he
    likes. The man uses the floor like a &quot;dance laboratory&quot;. So if your looking for
    something different in your turn patterns, then Vittico Pacheco may be the instructor for
    you.</font></p>

        <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The review above was written 10 
        years ago, a testament to Vittico's long experience as a New York 
        instructor.&nbsp; He has continued to develop and refine his teaching 
        and class methods.&nbsp; He is much respected in the mambo community for 
        his unique approach and authentic Latino style of dancing mambo.&nbsp;
