IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR DANCE TEAMS AND PERFORMERS AT THE 5th ANNUAL WEST
COAST SALSA CONGRESS</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Albert </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Torres
Productions, Inc. would like to congratulate the directors and their teams for
having been selected to perform and represent your city, state and country at
the 5th Annual West Coast Salsa Congress.<br>
We want to thank all the teams and performers that sent us their audition tapes.
Each year you make this process harder and harder due to the great talent and
versatility that is out there. Again, congratulations to the teams that were
selected and we hope that those of you that did not get chosen this year will
still attend and support the congress. There is always next year.<br>
<br>
We want to bring to your attention to some important details that will help all
of us make this event a fun and easy process. Please help us by following some
simple directions so we can give you the best Salsa Congress to date.<br>
<br>
The Directors of each team are responsible for contacting Albert Torres
Productions, Inc. for any information on their teams. Please ask your team
members to not contact us directly unless it is an emergency. ALL questions or
inquiries should come from the team's director. Sorry, if we receive phone calls
or e mails from close to 1,000 performers we will never get the schedules and
other important items completed in time.<br>
<br>
ALL TEAMS CHOSEN NEED TO REGISTER ON LINE BY MARCH 1, 2003. (NO EXCEPTIONS). WE
WILL ALSO NEED PAYMENT BY MARCH 1, 2003. IF WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED YOUR TEAMS
COMPLETED REGISTRATION AND PAYMENT BY THIS DATE, WE WILL ASSUME YOUR TEAM HAS
DECIDED NOT TO PERFORM THIS YEAR. PLEASE REGISTER UNDER THE PERFORMERS
REGISTRATION LOCATED ON MY WEBSITE AT <a href="http://www.alberttorresevents.com">www.alberttorresevents.com</a>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, THE
DIRECTORS OF YOUR TEAM SHOULD CONTACT MAYA TORRES AT <a href="mailto:maya@atpevents.com">maya@atpevents.com</a></font><br>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Any changes will be accepted till
May 1, 2003. After May 1, 2003 there will be a charge of $50 per change
(whatever the change).<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT INFORMATION:<br>
Bring at least two (2) CDs with only the music of your performance on the CD. If
the CD has more than your performance music, it will not be accepted. Only your
performance music should be on the CD. When mixing the performance music on your
CDs, please mix it on different brands of CDs, due to the problem that some
professional DJ's equipment don't read all the brands of CDs out in the market
today.<br>
Please bring these CDs to your scheduled rehearsal. We will inform you about
your scheduled performance date and rehearsal time about two weeks before the
congress.<br>
<br>
We require you to rehearse your number on stage with your full team.&nbsp; The
rehearsal time will be given to you ahead of time. Once it is confirmed, it is
mandatory that you show up to the rehearsal or you will not perform.<br>
<br>
Please try to use ORIGINAL music this year. There are some beautiful songs that
would make great performance music that have never been used. Be different this
year!<br>
<br>
No smoking will be allowed on stage at any time, due to LA Fire Dept,
regulations.<br>
<br>
70% of your performance music needs to be SALSA. Remember this is a SALSA
Congress.<br>
<br>
We are requesting strongly that your performance numbers do not contain guns or
violence. We are living in a stressful time with the world on edge. The purpose
of this Congress and the performances are to, &quot;Create Unity Through
Salsa&quot;.<br>
<br>
Please make sure that your costumes, performances and your music is appropriate
for all ages. At Albert Torres Productions, Inc we are very proud to have been
supportive of youth salsa groups all over the world. We believe in our events
being a safe and creative place for dancers of all ages and lovers of this
music. Without telling you how to dress or how to choreograph your numbers, we
are requesting that you keep all this information in mind when putting your
performance together.<br>
<br>
STRICT TIMETABLES FOR YOUR PERFORMANCES<br>
Due to the amount of teams performing, we have put together some firm guidelines
on how long your performance can be. If these guidelines are followed, your
performance will not have to be edited too much and will be selected to be part
of the West Coast Salsa Congress Videos seen all over the world. If at rehearsal
we feel you have not followed these guidelines, your team may not perform.
PLEASE work with us on this.<br>
<br>
If your team consists of 2-4 performers the time for your performance is limited
to 3 minutes.<br>
<br>
If your team consists of 4-6 performers, the time for your performance is
limited to 4 minutes.<br>
<br>
If your team consists of 8 or more performers, the time for your performance is
limited to 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
We believe that these are very fair guidelines so we can move the shows forward
in a timely manner. Please help make this possible. Please no e-mails or phone
calls asking for any changes of these guidelines for your performance.<br>
<br>
After your performance we will supply each team with a video copy of their
performance at no cost. Please be sure to pick up your video on the night of
your performance. Only one video tape per team.<br>
<br>
As in previous years, we will give one hotel room per team to all teams from
outside of the greater LA and Orange County area. We will pay for the hotel room
for Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday nights. This room will ONLY be for performers
on the selected team. Each room is limited to a maximum of 4 performers. Team
directors will be responsible that this gift is not abused. If we are made aware
that our confidence has been violated we will ask the directors to pay for the
room and the team will not perform. Please do not abuse this courtesy. If you
have any questions, please e-mail Maya Torres at <a href="mailto:maya@atpevents.com">maya@atpevents.com</a>
(Directors Only Please). If you are interested in coming earlier or staying
later in your hotel room we can offer you our discounted rates as long as you
register through ATP as soon as possible. All other hotel rooms needed for the
rest of your team need to be registered and paid through ATP so we can get you
the best rates possible through our blockage of hotel rooms. Don't wait too
long, the rooms are going very fast. Over 600 registrations from over 35
countries have already been received. This does not include all the instructors,
musicians, VIP guests and dance teams that are about to register.<br>
<br>
We have reserved all the rooms in one hotel to make it one big party and easier
for transportation. All rooms this year have been reserved and guaranteed by
Albert Torres at the LAX Hilton Hotel at a Congress discounted rate if you get
the room through Albert Torres Productions at <a href="http://www.alberttorresevents.com">www.alberttorresevents.com</a>
All Hotel Registrations For The Congress Teams And Attendees Need To Go Through
ATP. Register Online Today Before The Prices Go Up!<br>
<br>
If you choose to go through other means to reserve your hotel room, we cannot
guarantee that your room will be available. Last year a few people choose to
register directly with the hotel and ended up having to be moved to another
hotel because of our hotel blockage. Many times the hotel operators will sell
you a reservation without being aware that we have blocked all available rooms
in the hotel for our attendees. Make your life easier and just register through
us. We guarantee your room 100% if you book it through us.<br>
<br>
Discounted rates can also be applied to dates before and after the congress as
long as they are reserved through ATP. We will also give out coupons for
discounts at the hotel restaurant and spa/gym. We are working on getting
discount tickets for the various Hollywood attractions, ie: Disneyland, Magic
Mountain, Universal Studios etc. Free Airport Shuttle Service (24 Hours) from
LAX airport to the LAX Hilton hotel.<br>
<br>
Shuttle Buses From Hotel To Hollywood Park (Evening Venue)<br>
Provided For All Attendees That Register For Congress &amp; Hotel Through Us.
All Others Will Be Charged A Shuttle Fee Each Way.<br>
<br>
FULL EVENT PASS INFORMATION AND LATIN MADNESS<br>
Dance teams selected and ONLY their dancers performing at the West Coast Salsa
Congress will be able to attend Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday evenings at no
cost. We strongly suggest that your dancers chosen to perform at the Congress to
buy a Full Event Pass that will only cost them $50 for the entire weekend. This
pass will entitled them to the Thursday Pre Congress Party and all the
workshops. They will also be able to get the discount entrance to Latin Madness
of only $20 for a total package cost of $70. Those not buying the Full Event
Pass For Performers will then have to pay $25 for Latin Madness, $15 For The Pre
Congress Party and not be able to attend any workshops. The $50 fee entitles the
performer to attend the Thursday night party and all of the workshops and
remember we are bringing the best instructors of Salsa in the world. For $70 you
will get all of the above and Latin Madness.<br>
(Sorry, Team Members Not Performing Are Not Entitled To This Special Price). We
will be reviewing dance team registrations with the amount of dancers performing
on stage. Any differences could be cause for your team not to perform. Assistant
Stage Manager will confirm with the amount of dancers performing with Directors
of each team at rehearsal.<br>
<br>
NEW SPECIAL PERFORMANCE TENT<br>
Remember: We are building a special tent for the evening performances. The tent
will hold over 3,000 seats. We heard your concerns and each year we try to make
the LA Congress better. There will also be DJ's playing music during the shows
for those dancers that prefer to dance then watch the shows.<br>
<br>
The musician's stage with various large dance floors will be moved outside under
the tent. We will then lift the sides of the tent so we will get the fresh air
and dance almost under the stars. All of the evening events will be at The
Hollywood Park Casino where we can dance till 4AM. The address of the Hollywood
Park Casino is 3883 W Century Blvd in Inglewood, California.<br>
<br>
We will have dancing in another room to international DJ's playing music during
the shows for those interested in dancing and not watching the shows.<br>
<br>
PRESENTING SPONSOR'S DANCE COMPETITION<br>
Albert Torres Productions, Inc. and our presenting sponsor are pleased to
announce that they will be presenting the qualifying rounds of a special dance
competition as part of the 5th Annual West Coast Salsa Congress. Everyone
including professional performers and instructors are invited to participate in
this open salsa dance competition. These qualifying rounds will be conducted on
Friday May 23, 2003 from 1:00PM-3:00PM at the LAX Hilton International Ballroom.
The couples selected from the qualifying round will be eligible to participate
in the finals of the competition. Couples picked for the finals should be
prepared to perform a two minute routine to their pre recorded CD. The finals
will be conducted at the Hollywood Park Casino on Saturday May 24, 2003 at

This dance competition will give all 5th Annual West Coast Salsa Congress
attendees a chance to win a grand prize of $7,500. The dance competition will be
judged by a renowned panel of judges who will select the dance pair that will
win the chance to compete at the finals at Lincoln Center'' Midsummer Night
Swing in July in New York City. The grand prize in New York City is $7,500. All
interested in participating in the qualifying round of the dance competition

<br>
WORKSHOPS<br>
All day events including workshops will be held at the LAX Hilton hotel.&nbsp;
We are working on making the workshops not as crowded and with monitors so you
can see the instructors well. We will have the risers higher for the
instructors. The intermediate and advanced workshops will be held at the LAX
Hilton's ballroom with high ceilings. The beginner workshops will also be held
at the LAX Hilton but in a room with the ceiling not as high. We will provide
monitors. We will also provide a separate room for dancing to DJ's music during
the day workshops. The only time we will not have a room for dancing to DJ music
is during the educational workshops at noon on Sat and Sun for 1 ½ hours each
day.<br>
