<p>Believe or not, one of the hottest dance spots in NYC (in my humble opinion)
is not the Copa, Latin Quarters or even Wild Palms, its <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy
Antons </a>Social Dance. Held the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Sunday of
every month between the hours of 5-9 p.m. at the DANCE MANHATTAN Dance Studio
located at 39 West 19th Street, NYC 10011. <b>The event is currently in its 7<sup>th</sup>
year (as of February 2000),</b> making it the longest running social dance in
NY. If <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> is the King
of NY Mambo dancing, then Jimmy is the King of the NY Social dance scene.</p>
<p>What I love about the place is that its not a club, just a spot where
people who love to dance mambo come to mingle and let loose. Jimmy is well loved
and respected in the NY mambo community. He is a laid back and easy going
individual who loves to have a good time and hes able to project these same
traits into his event. Thats why its become the perfect melting pot for many
different NY mambo dance cliques. On any given Sunday, it common to find dancers
from Jimmy Antons School mixing it up with students of <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie
Torres</a>, <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie Diaz</a>, <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
Flores</a>, <a href="../instructors/razz_m_tazz.htm">Razz M Tazz</a>, <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille
Thomas</a>, <a href="../instructors/ismael_otero.htm">Ismael Otero </a>or <a href="../instructors/carlos_konig.htm">Carlos
Koenig</a>. Its also a common hang out spot for the 3 major webzine authors in
the NY area - Steve Shaw <a href="http://wwwsalsanewyork.com">(SalsaNewyork.com)</a>,
Fernando LaMadrid <a href="http://www.justsalsa.com">(JustSalsa.com)</a> and
myself (formally of <a href="http://www.salsaweb.com/ny">SalsawebNY,</a> now a part of <a href="http://wwwsalsanewyork.com">SalsaNewyork.com</a>)
. Many top mambo
instructors like <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille
Thomas</a>, <a href="../instructors/carlos_konig.htm">Carlos
Koenig</a>, <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie Diaz</a>, <a href="../instructors/luis_zegarra.htm">Luis
Zegarra</a>, <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson Flores</a>, <a href="../instructors/bernard_martinez.htm">Bernard
Martinez</a> and <a href="../instructors/razz_m_tazz.htm">Angel Rodriguez</a>
have been know to cut up the dance floor there. Just as many professional
dancers from some of NYs top dance teams come to hit the spot for an early
evening of dancing. Jimmy also periodically has dance teams perform at his
socials, such as the Side Street Kids, Young Ambition, Curvas Peligrosas,
SalsaBrava, Los Rumberos and Descarga Latina. Jimmys Social has also become a
frequent stop for many out of town salseros whove come to check out the NY
salsa/mambo scene. Ive personally have met people from Canada, Hong Kong,
Japan, London, Italy, DC, LA, SF, Baltimore and Chicago.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="articles_images/jimmya2.jpg" width="296" height="224"><br>
Many well known NY Instructors like <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com">Addie Diaz</a>
(right) and Team Dancer like ex-Eddie Torres Jammer and now Razz M'Tazz dancer
Mari-elena First (left), like to go to Jimmy's to let loose on the dance floor.</p>
<p>But Jimmys Social are not for just for top dancers. Its the perfect
stepping stone for those not bold enough to hit the club scene. People come to
practice. Usually what happens is that they come, they practice, they mess up,
laugh, and go back and try it again. Bottom line, theres no pressure, just
fun. The idea is to have a good time. And Like I always say if youre not
having FUN then its not worth doing. I like to think of it as a place to be
inspired, trade idea, release tension and be at ease. Its an opportunity to do
what I call my meditation in motion.....a.k.a. relax. If youre into people
watching then its a great place for you to admire the art of NY mambo dancing
or maybe even pick up some moves. <b>Though out of respect for your fellow
dancers, easy on the video cameras. Please ask for permission before taping.
Think of it as a courtesy to your fellow dancer.</b></p>
<p>For those of you without a partner, dont worry. The B.Y.O.P (bring your
own partner) rule does not apply here. There are plenty of good dancers to go
around for all levels. Everyone dances with everyone. Its not a pick up
joint, so women dont have to worry about that. And Ive never seen a
problem occur. I think that everyone is there for only one reason: <b>TO DANCE. </b>So
dont be shy to ask someone to out on the dance floor (this goes for you too
girls). If youre a good dancer, expect to have your dance card filled
quickly.</p>

Jimmy's Social is a popular hang out for many in the NY<br>
Mambo Scene</p>
<p>Jimmys Sunday Social has everything going for it. Its centrally located in
NYC, has a huge dance floor that is ideal to dance on and it starts and ends
early enough on Sunday so that it doesnt interrupt with your nights sleep.
The music is spun by Jimmy himself. Thats awesome because only a dancer would
know what tunes to play to get your feet itching-to-twitch on the dance floor
(some of NYs DJs are dancers, just think Henry Knowles or DJ Elvira).
Those 17-18 year old dancers need look no further. Refreshments, not liquor are
serve at the social. So by all means come out and play with the rest of us <b>mamboholics.</b></p>
<p><b>There can only be one Jimmy Antons social.</b> Copied by many but never
truly duplicated. It ranks a 3 to 4 t-shirt alert. Meaning that you should bring
about 3-4 dry t-shirts and a towel (not to mention plenty of water) to stay dry,
keep fresh and not disgust your potential dance partners with your perspiration.
Thats how much dancing you can get in if you want. Cover charge is usually
$9.00 (or about $12 if there is a dance group performing that day).</p>
