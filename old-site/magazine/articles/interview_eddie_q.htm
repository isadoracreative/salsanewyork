      began studying music with the piano at the age of 10 years old and later,
      at the age of 12, Eddie switched to the guitar and has evolved into an
      accomplished jazz guitarist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eddie
      formed and was director of his musical group, Progression, with the fusion
      of elements of be-bop, funk, Latin jazz and R &amp; B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Some of the musicians that played along side Eddie Q in Progression
      were the likes of such greats as, Arturo OFarril on piano, son of the
      late, great composer, Chico OFarril, and also on piano, Igor Atalita
      (who has played and recorded with all the major bands in the New York

      failed to supply adequate instructors and support for Mambo, Eddie was an
      avid believer that true progress for the dance would come through
      consistency in practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two
      years later, Eddie was invited to teach Mambo at SCDC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Eddie brought incredible energy and insight of the dance and the
      music to his six year tenure at SCDC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      though a knowledge of music does not guarantee the ability to produce a

      dance.</font></p>

      </span></b>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Eddie Q,
      for taking the time to talk to me today.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Eddie, what would you consider to be an important factor for the
      initial development and growth of a mambo dancer?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><img border="0" src="articles_images/EddieQ_2.jpg" align="left" width="228" height="300">Eddie
      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I am a firm believer in
      strong basics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first thing
      you have to do is to explain to them how the music works.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>What they are going to dance to, how many beats they are dancing to
      and the main thing is they have to hear their one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They will not hear any other beat, in their dance pattern, unless
      they find the one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
      you find your one you can find any other beat. If they dont know
      where their one is they wont know where their two is and
      they wont know where anything else is. You need to be a stickler for
      proper dance technique from the beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Ive seen so-called advanced mambo dancers that never
      really developed strong basics nor good techniques  whether it be form,
      spins, basic footwork, or leading techniques.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Unfortunately, these dancers cant hide their shortcomings on the
      dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>My motto is
      you have to pay your dues meaning: You <b>have</b> to practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I am directing my comments to the person that wishes to develop
      into a strong salsa/mambo dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
      though the harsh reality that I became aware of is that probably 80% of
      the students at SCDC were there just to socialize and did not take the
      dance seriously. This seems to be the trend at larger studios that offer
      many different kinds of dances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Part
      of the development of the dancer should include a lot of trips to clubs
      that feature great dancers on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You can learn a lot by watching.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Case in point: I have observed one of the top mambo
      instructor/dancer in NYC at the Flamingo Dance Club videotaping dancers on
      the floor.</font></p>

      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the dancer to be
      able to interpret the rhythm and groove of the music and great technique.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Some dancers dance on one, others dance on the Eddie Torres two,
      but the reality is that these particular styles dont work well with
      some mambo/salsa numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rhythmically
      they are more challenging.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
      dancers only dance what they have been taught and very few take what they
      have learned to the next level where they can make it their own and
      improvise with it, especially rhythmically. Last, but not least, the smile
      of a dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I have a personal
      acquaintance who is also an instructor, <a href="../instructors/david_negley.htm">David
      Negley</a>, who always has a smile when he dances and even when he walks
      through the dance floor.</font></p>

      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Directly or indirectly,
      <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> has been an
      influence to most dancers and instructors in the last 10 to 20 years;
      whether it be through actual lessons with Eddie Torres or an instructor
      that has been influenced by him. Any of the guys that teach, whether
      its <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy Anton</a>, or any of
      those guys, they all have come as a derivative from him, Eddie Torres.
      They might have decided on different styles, but they have all been
      influenced by Eddie Torres.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
      was directly influenced by a fellow by the name of Pedro Fernandez who I
      think has exceptional technique and groove; indirectly, by <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy
      Anton</a> and <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille Thomas</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Also, Freddie Rios was an influence when it came to groove and
      rhythm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Oscar Soto was the
      first cat that I saw on the floor that grooved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Ann Marie Parasole who, just by dancing with her, taught me about
      groove and Raul Avila who had a certain finesse about his dancing.
      Indirectly Angel Figueroa who not only is one of the best dance
      technicians but a sight to see on the floor. For those of you that think
      that white dancers can't groove, a fellow by the name of Jojo Saltpeter
      who just by watching is a lesson in groove.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
      </span>I continuously try to keep my dance evolving through practice,
      improvisation, creativity and constant influences from other up and coming
      dancers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eddie
      Q:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></b><a href="../../calendar.htm">Socials</a>
      are intimidating for new dancers but my advice is  stick it out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You usually get all levels of the dance at socials and it is a good
      learning ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently
      there are about 3-4 socials that run on alternate Sundays beginning from
      the first to the fourth and sometimes fifth, Sunday of the month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Although sometimes certain DJs do not have a good sense of mixing
      the music.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the DJs
      tend to play consecutively<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>3-5
      super-fast numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
      looking across the dance floor, some dancers are racing through sloppy
      turn patterns and some dancers are off-time and ignoring their dance slot.
      But on the other hand, it is a good place to observe other dancers and get
      a good cardiovascular workout.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Take
      at least one to two changes of clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Another spot is Flamingo Dance Club (Mondays) on W21st street (good
      dance floor and good dancers).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      Copa on Tuesdays (good floor, good music).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Club Babalu on Thursdays (good floor, good dj) and La Belle Epoque,
      also on Thursdays (good bands, great dj, Dave), Fridays and Saturdays,
      Wild Palms (good floor, good bands and dj).</font></p>

      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lack of practice. They
      take one class, they come back the following week without having practiced
      one bit and its frustrating because not only do you have to review last
      week and hopefully build on that but you have a certain amount of time to
      cover certain material.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
      people do practice and it is not fair to them because now they must slow
      down to accommodate those people that totally forgot what they learned the
      week before.</font></p>

      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Kudos to the
      performers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not easy to
      memorize an entire dance performance and execute it under pressure before
      a live audience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I recently
      had the distinct pleasure of seeing the <a href="latin_madness_IV_home.htm">off-Broadway
      production, Latin Madness </a>which featured some of our most
      talented mambo dancers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
      entertained through humor, and the level of the dancers and their numbers
      were inspiring. I truly appreciate the efforts of the performers. My only
      critique of some performances is that the performers concentrate only on
      tricks and lifts and are lacking in the presentation of the dance that
      they are representing which is mambo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Although I have noticed that some performers are better social
      dancers than performers.</font></p>

      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Personally, I prefer
      the Palladium 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is 2, 3
      4, 6, 7, 8.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I can dance and
      teach all the other styles, but I feel this particular style the most.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If you watch Eddie Torres, who has made the 1, 2, 3 5, 6, 7 style
      of on two famous, you will notice that he, when social dancing, will
      revert back to the Palladium 2, naturally.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>PM:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eddie
      Q:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></b>First, I would like to
      say, that I am stimulated by great arrangements and great musicians.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Unfortunately, some of the salsa or mambo that we have has either
      sub par musicians or lousy arrangements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In some of the recordings that we listen to, either the horns are
      out of tune,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>or the bass is
      sometimes out of tune.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
      will affect my ability to dance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once,
      at the Copa while dancing I had to stop and ask the band leader to please
      have his bass player tune his bass<b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span></b>Some of the artists that I enjoy are Ray Barreto, Tito Puente,
      Eddie Palmieri, Los Soneros del Barrio, with the great pianist Ricky
      Gonzalez, Sonora Ponseña with the great pianist Papo Luca, Fania All
      Stars, Manny Oquendo y conjunto libre, Willie Rosario and too many more to
      mention.</font></p>

      </span>Do you have any issues with finding a partner to dance with or the

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eddie
      Q:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></b>What I feel is that at
      the socials there are those that are taking classes all over the place and
      are stuck on chachi moves and the styling things of the female dancers and
      technically they are horrible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      cant really go through any of the patterns and if you try to put them
      through the patterns, they are lagging behind on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You can quote me on this  <b>the essence of the dancer is timing</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It is essential that you have a good understanding of time, groove
      and the ability to move on the dance floor. Although, I do cater the dance
      to the person that I am dancing with at the moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>I have seen inexperienced male dancers ask a female with limited
      dance abilities, and the male is totally oblivious to the females lower
      level of dancing and is trying to put this female through turn patterns
      after turn patterns and the female looks like she is totally hanging on
      for dear life.</font></p>

      to attitudes and cliques on the dance floor?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eddie
      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I happen to be a
      Caucasian looking Puerto Rican and I have gotten major attitudes from
      women in clubs who do not know me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      automatically assume that I cannot dance because of my skin color but
      during the first 30 seconds of the dance, they feel<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>my groove.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Guys, if one
      female rejects your invitation to dance, move on to the next female and do
      not take it personally.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
      you encounter a clique, try to infiltrate it by simply asking for a dance
      in a gentlemanly or ladylike manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
      either rejects, be persistent and ask again at a later time. Some dancers
      take their dancing very seriously, and will only dance with the better
      dancers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But people, if
      you are asking a good dancer to dance, whether it be female or male, at
      least try to have some of your stuff together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>And guys, if you are going to ask a female that is with a guy to
      dance, acknowledge and ask the guy for permission to dance with the
      female.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I have experienced and
      have seen that some men lack the basic knowledge of the rules of etiquette
      on the dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, if
      you happen to bump into someone on the dance floor, politely apologize and
      smile  that will go a long way.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eddie
      Q:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></b>The dance has taken on
      more technical elements of other dances, such as hustle, west coast swing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I encounter old time dancers that are sticklers for their
      particular way of dancing and refuse and bad mouth where the dance has
      gone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, you
      have the newer dancers that are into turn patterns only and fail to get
      the essence and authenticity of the dance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I have benefited from the original form of mambo to the current
      more technical style of mambo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
      all good!</font></p>

      </span>What do you think about the borage of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>dance videos that are coming out.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eddie
      Q:</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I think its a great
      thing to get so much information from so many different sources.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>My only critique is that some instructors, on the videos have a
      poor grasp of the English language and at times, stumble on their own
      words</font></p>
