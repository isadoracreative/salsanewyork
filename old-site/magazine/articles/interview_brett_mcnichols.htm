  &nbsp;<b><br>
  BM: </b>Ive
  been dancing mambo formally since December 1999 when I took my first class at
  Dance Manhattan in NYC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Before that I would dance mambo socially at nightclubs throughout the
  city and Westchester, and at family parties. I always loved Latin music, but
  the advanced dancers I would see in clubs throughout the city intimidated me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I started going to Latin clubs back in like, 1994, and whenever the D.J.
  would play Salsa, the dance floor would clear and only a few couples would
  dance, and I would just stand there and watch... I was in awe of the beauty
  and detail of mambo dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>That really made me determined to learn this form of dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I was truly impressed by the intricate turn patterns and the rhythm of
  the music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Little
  by little, I would inch my way onto the dance floor and dance with whoever
  would ask, and every time I would social dance, I would learn something new.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Then it got to the point where I felt frustrated with my stagnant level
  of dancing, and decided it was time to enroll in dance classes to really
  increase my knowledge of mambo dancing in a formal atmosphere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  <b>BM: </b>My
  first formal dance class in mambo was at Dance Manhattan with Eleanor Lopez.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I remember the very first class... I went out that day and bought new
  dance shoes, and by the end of the class my feet were killing me!! I still
  remember the shines we learned and even my first cross body lead!! I remember
  thinking that one inside turn was the hardest thing to do in mambo!!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Eleanor was an excellent instructor, she was tough, but she made sure
  you did everything correct!! At the time, Eleanor was teaching on the 234, 678
  timing, so I decided to try classes that taught on the 123, 567 timing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>The following summer of 2000, I started going to on 2&quot; social
  events, and taking classes with <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm"> Addie Diaz</a> and with
  <a href="../instructors/thomas_guerrero.htm"> Thomas Guerrero</a> at Santo
  Rico Dance School.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I learned a great deal of shines, turn patterns and ladies
  spinning/styling in these classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span>This was an excellent opportunity for me to improve as a dancer. Addie
  is truly my first mentor who really taught me everything I know (good and bad)
  about being a professional dancer. I think that if<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  <b>BM:</b> Compared to others, Ive
  only been teaching mambo for a short period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I would love to expand in this area of my dancing career because I love
  to help people who want to learn this form of dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I remember how I felt when I was first starting out, and I can see the
  same determination in the eyes of other dancers when they are learning their
  first mambo steps!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span>I
  originally taught ballet to young children in Westchester for a couple of
  years, and I really enjoyed it. Teaching
  any form of dance really gives you the opportunity to master that form of
  dance as well.... when students ask you questions, you think of details that
  you may have passed over before, and you really improve as a dancer yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  think the best part of teaching someone is when you see a student improve
  right before your eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Some students are insecure and dont think that they will ever
  get a move or concept, and when the finally succeed, you get this
  amazing sense of<b> </b>accomplishment as a teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  </b></span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Another
  benefit about teaching is that you always learn more about what youre
  teaching while you are explaining it to a group of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  a student will ask a question that you never would have thought of, and as
  youre explaining the technique in detail you think to yourself wow,

  is an excellent learning experience for both the student and the teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  &nbsp;<br>
  BM: </span></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">I
  think the most frustrating part of teaching is when you are teaching a large
  group of students and half of them are picking up really fast, and the other
  half is totally lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Its hard to please everyone, but you have to really get a feel for
  the overall level of a group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Its always important to give each person individual attention, and
  to make sure that no one feels frustrated or incompetent. You dont want to
  intimidate people who are not very advanced and need a lot of repetition, and
  you dont want to slow down the people who are looking to learn more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I also find it challenging when a student is not very determined and
  gives up easily. its hard to get some people to come out of their
  shells and just dance!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>One of the most common questions Ive heard from beginners is.. How
  long is it going to take for me to get really good at this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>The answer to this question totally depends on the student and how
  determined they truly are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>If a student only comes to class once a week, theyre not going to
  improve that quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Its important to practice at home in front of a mirror, and to go
  out to clubs and social dance!!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I hate to discourage new students, but if they dont dedicate the
  time, theyre really not going to notice fast improvement. <b><o:p>

  really enjoy dancing at clubs and social events where there are good on

  dancing with, that always ends up being a great time out.... and a late
  night!!<b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span></b>When
  I first started taking classes at Dance Manhattan, I made friends with a group
  of students there who I used to go out social dancing with all the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>It was the best, we would go to class, and then go out to the Copa or
  Latin Quarters right after class and practice what we had just learned! Those
  were the days!! <b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></b>One
  of the best feelings when you go out social dancing is when a complete
  stranger approaches you and compliments your dancing, and theyre really
  sincere about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>It really gives you a great sense of accomplishment... I always think
  back to when I used to stand on the sidelines and watch someone dance... I
  would always approach them and tell them how much I admired their dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Its even a greater sense of accomplishment then hearing an audience
  applaud for you... sometimes I get the feeling that applause is obligatory
  during a performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>When someone goes out of their way to tell you how much they enjoy
  watching you dance... <i>that </i>is a genuine expression of their
  appreciation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  </span>When I am learning a new choreography, one of the best exercises to
  memorize the steps is to write down the sequence and keep repeating it in your
  mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>I
  used to do this with new shines or turn patterns that I would learn in a

  writing down the choreography, you can go over it while riding the train,
  before you go to sleep, wherever!! Just as long as you keep repeating the
  sequence of the choreography in your mind the rest will come naturally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>Then of course, when you have the time (and the space) you have to
  practice as much as you can!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  for a workshop requires more time and thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>You have to almost choreograph what you are going to teach and make
  certain that you know that choreography backwards and forwards before you
  attempt to break it down to a room full of people!!! When I taught the
  workshop in DC I first consulted with Addie Diaz and got a lot of little tips
  and pointers on teaching a successful workshop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  of the students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>I also prepared a detailed list of techniques that I went over with the
  class while teaching them. This way the students have something to take home
  with them that always works better then trying to remember what you learned a

  I think the advantage that New York has over other parts of the country is the
  fact that our city is one of the most populated cities in the country, so we
  totally benefit by having such an immense mambo community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>When you visit other cities, there are usually only one or two clubs
  that play a good deal of salsa, and entertain a small group of quality
  dancers.<b> </b>Mambo dancing doesnt only exist in Manhattan, you can find
  great mambo clubs and dancers in all of the 5 boroughs of New York and in
  Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>So our options are abundant with a wide variety of venues in which we
  can enjoy mambo dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></b>The
  dancing in New York has a lot of flavor and passion that I dont seem to
  find in other parts of the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

  dancer, no matter what form of dance they are pursuing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>But in the business world of dancing, it is more difficult to achieve a
  genuine level of respect from your peers or clients because they have no idea
  how much work and time is invested in preparing for a performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>For example, when most people want to hire dancers, they may think that
  $150 is a huge price to pay per dancer when they are only putting on a 15
  minute show, but they fail to recognize the fact that the dancers have been <a href="the_cost_of_dancing.htm">
  investing hours and weeks of rehearsals and costume fittings for a mere 15
  minute show</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>This is where the dancers are not given the level of respect that they
  deserve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>I
  guess it truly depends on the venue and people you are dealing with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
