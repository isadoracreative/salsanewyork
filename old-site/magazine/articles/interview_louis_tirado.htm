        month we interview NY Mambo Instructor &amp; Performer <a href="../instructors/louis_tirado.htm">Louis
        Tirado</a>. Louis has been part of the New York dance scene for several
        years now.&nbsp;He is a very low key and down-to-earth instructor who is
        always smiling and laughing when he dances. He loves to dance and it
        shows on his face. Like many other of
        the mambo instructors I've been fortunate enough to meet, Louis truly cares
        about the quality of his&nbsp; teaching. This will be his second exposure to the internet mambo
        scene (<a href="../instructors/louis_tirado.htm">his SalsaNewYork
        instructor listing</a> was the first). I'm happy to be the person to re-introduce
        him to the internet viewing public.</font></p>

        to always have fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dont
        make it more than what it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Find
        a good teacher, and remember to practice, practice, practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Sometimes learning about how to hear the clave or learning the
        count can make some want to stop going to classes because theyre
        unfamiliar concepts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
        may have social danced all your life and you may feel that counting may
        make you mechanical as a dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        soon youll learn to internalize all those things so that so that they
        become second nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
        are no shortcuts to becoming a great mambo dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Some people learn faster than others, but learn with your heart
        and youll enjoy it forever.</font></p>

        only natural after dancing under someone for a long time that you
        develop some of their style, so I understand where my style comes from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I appreciate it, and Im thankful for it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I only hope that eventually someone will say that they
        derived their style from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
        has to be one of the best compliments you can give a fellow dancer.&nbsp;<b>My
        teaching style </b>is one of extreme patience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I like to drill my students on a move over and over, till its
        second nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then perhaps
        reintroduce the step or turn pattern at a later date or time, just to
        make sure the student hasnt forgotten it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
