        month we interview NJ Mambo Instructor &amp; Performer Jai Catalano.
        I've know Jai for several years now and mark my words he and his partner
        Candy will be a force to contend with in the NY/NJ Mambo community. He
        is a hard working and dedicated dance professional who truly cares about
        his dancing and the quality of his teaching. In this interview Jai
        candidly talks about Eddie Torres, Tito Puente and about dancing on
        stage as a mambo performer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Jai Catalano Cyber-Interview:<br>
<br>
<font color="#000080">SNY</font></strong><b><font color="#000080">:&nbsp;How
long have you been dancing mambo and what got you into it?<br>
</font>JC: </b>I started learning salsa on the 1 at the Sandra Cameron Dance
School in<br>
downtown Manhattan.&nbsp; That was in February of 1998.&nbsp; I stayed there
about 2<br>
months until I was convinced to go to the 2.&nbsp; I have been on the 2 ever<br>
since, although I can still maintain the 1 if I had to.&nbsp; So I guess the
answer<br>
is 3 years.&nbsp; At the time I started inquiring about salsa, I had just gotten<br>
out of a 5 year relationship.&nbsp; My ex-girlfriend knows how to dance what I<br>
call House Salsa.&nbsp; That is salsa that is taught by your parents
without a<br>
timing structure.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I didn't know Salsa from Merengue let
alone<br>
the 1 from the 2, and she didn't know how to teach me either, so after an<br>
amicable split I looked on the internet and found my first salsa school by my<br>
house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: Where did you originally learn how to dance mambo and who was (were)<br>
your mentors?&nbsp;</font><br>
JC: </b>
I originally learned how to dance salsa from Sandra Cameron herself, but<br>
after dancing for 2 months a friend had given me information about <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie<br>
Torres</a>.&nbsp; Immediately knew I was going to take classes there once I saw his<br>
class.&nbsp; I don't want it to sound like a cliché but <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie Torres</a> is my
mentor<br>
because he not only taught me how to dance, but he guided me towards feeling<br>
the music, and enjoying the music.&nbsp; I spent many nights till 3 or close to
4<br>
in the morning after our late night rehearsals talking to Eddie.&nbsp; He showed<br>
me extra moves and taught me about music and theory.&nbsp; He is not just my<br>
mentor but he is my good friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: How long have you been teaching mambo and what
made you decide to teach mambo?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I have been teaching mambo for about 1 year now, but it wasn't until <a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm"> Candy<br>
Mena</a>, my girlfriend, convinced me to open up a <a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm#schedule"> school with her in West New<br>
York New Jersey</a> that I decided that I would give it 110%.&nbsp; I have always<br>
cross-referenced my teaching with people like Eddie Torres, <a href="../instructors/frankie_martinez.htm"> Frankie<br>
Martinez</a>, Seaon Bristol, and even <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm"> Nelson
Flores</a>.&nbsp;Candy and I are meticulous<br>
with our teaching and very serious about the growth of our students.&nbsp; It is<br>
these people, who I mentioned above, that have given me a certain<br>
understanding about teaching and the business at hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: Name your favorite on stage performance?</font><br>
JC: </b>
My favorite on stage performance was the performance Candy and I did in<br>
Brooklyn College with the late great <a href="tito_puente_experience.htm"> Tito
Puente</a>.&nbsp; <a href="tito_puente_experience.htm">I wrote an article on my<br>
experience that day</a>.&nbsp; That was undisputedly the best.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What is it like to learn a choreographed routine?<br>
</font>JC: </b>
The question should be Manny, What is it like to learn a routine from <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie<br>
Torres</a> as oppose to others?&nbsp; Eddie is a masterful choreographer and he is<br>
constantly revising his routines.&nbsp; Not to say that others are not good, but<br>
once you think you have learned a routine from Eddie Torres he slips the<br>
carpet from under your feet and redoes it.&nbsp; I have learned choreography
from<br>
others and it is a totally different experience.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What is it like to travel as a performer? What do you like best about it?</font><br>
JC: </b>
It is a great feeling to know that once you start traveling out of New York<br>
and even the New Jersey area that the level of acceptance and intensity of<br>
that acceptance grows.&nbsp; People are happier to see you and what you have to<br>
offer.&nbsp; I have watched performances in New York where I have heard the
person<br>
next to me say ohhhh these people again.&nbsp; I guess that might apply to<br>
wherever you live but undoubtedly it is a greater feeling once you go<br>
abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: Where have you gone to perform?</font><br>
JC: </b>
Aside from the fact that I have traveled and performed a lot around the US, I<br>
have only performed at Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic.&nbsp; As of this
year,<br>
that is all going to increasingly change.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: Name some of your performances?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I have performed for the Puerto Rican Congreso.&nbsp; I have done channel 41 a
few<br>
times.&nbsp; I performed live in the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; That was real
fun.&nbsp; I<br>
also performed at the Tito Puente tribute at Madison Square Garden.&nbsp;Oh and
I<br>
cant forget Tito Puentes 76th and 77th birthday party.&nbsp; And many many
more<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: Which bands have you performed with on stage?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I have performed with Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Eddie Palmieri, Jose Alberto,<br>
Jorge Luis, Frankie Negron, Domingo Quinones, Oscar De leon, Sergio Vargas.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What got you into performing and what was your first time on stage?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I guess I should say I got myself into performing, but it was <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie Torres</a><br>
who allowed me the first outlet to do it.&nbsp; I can never forget my first time<br>
on stage.&nbsp; It was at Bistro Latino in January of 1999.&nbsp;
Coincidentally, Candy<br>
was in the audience for my first show and we didn't even know each other<br>
then.&nbsp; Even when I see the video, from time to time, I can see Candy in the<br>
background watching.&nbsp; Id like to say she was watching only me but that
would<br>
only be me talking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What groups have you performed with?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I have only performed with <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie
Torres</a>.&nbsp;Now, <a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm#dance_company"> Candy and I perform</a> under our<br>
own names but I still perform with Eddie Torres whenever he needs us.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What did you feel when you first performed live on stage?</font><br>
JC:</b>
I felt confident but it was before the show that I was in shambles.&nbsp; When I<br>
am on stage it is great feeling.&nbsp; It is when I am just about to go on that
I<br>
am a little nervous.&nbsp; I guess you can say it is the anticipation that kills<br>
me<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What do you like about being a dance choreographer?</font><br>
JC: </b>
The best part about being a choreographer is that you get to see your<br>
choreography come alive from within.&nbsp; <a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm#dance_company">I have just recently started to<br>
choreograph more and more</a> and I believe that the feelings that are within me<br>
will be well received by the audiences that I perform for.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What do you look for in a song when you are putting choreography together for
it?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I never look for anything in a song.&nbsp; I feel for a song.&nbsp; My music
producer<br>
(Garth M.) taught me that as well as <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie
Torres</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my
lyrical<br>
understanding for a Latin song is minimal at best, but my feeling for a song<br>
is as strong as yours or anyone else.&nbsp; I have been involved in the music<br>
field for quiet some time but I have quickly learned that without a strong<br>
feeling from the heart, you can only hope to achieve a contrived<br>
interpretation for the musical task at hand.&nbsp; Therefore, I need to feel for<br>
the song.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What advice would you give those just getting into mambo? How can they work
at getting better at dancing?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I guess the first thing I would have to say is if you truly love mambo (is to) stick through the process.&nbsp; It is a rough ride for people in the beginning.&nbsp;Dont be upset that the intermediate
(dancers) dont ask you to dance.&nbsp; It is
just a
part of how the intermediate (dancers) grow towards being advance.&nbsp; We were all
there.&nbsp;The first day I started learning partner work a women rotated to me while we
danced the moves we had just learned.&nbsp; She told me that I needed to do the
move right and that if I didnt know what I was doing then I shouldnt be
there.&nbsp; I was embarrassed and determined to be one of the best.&nbsp; She
now asks
me to dance every time I see her.&nbsp; We are good friends to this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: How best could you describe your way of dancing? Of teaching? And of<br>
performing?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I love to have fun no matter what I do.&nbsp; I learn better when I have fun.&nbsp;<br>
When I dance I dont dance without putting my smiling face on.&nbsp;If I am
not<br>
smiling I usually am sitting. Not to say I am unhappy when Is it but I have<br>
to rest my jaw as well as my feet.&nbsp; Teaching and performing are always in<br>
need of that same formula.&nbsp; Then, of course, you have to be
interested in<br>
doing what you do.&nbsp; I am extremely happy, blessed, and in full enjoyment of<br>
my dancing, teaching, and performing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font>
        </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#000080">SNY: Do you still like to go to clubs and dance socially?</font><br>
JC: </b>
I love to go out every so often, &nbsp;but because I am constantly rehearsing I<br>
find myself less and less at clubs and socials.&nbsp; I find it important for
the<br>
growth of mambo to have as many dancers as possible frequenting those<br>
events.&nbsp; I dont have a regular spot that I go to, but there are quiet a
few<br>
spots that I wish I could attend more than I do.&nbsp; However, on the positive<br>
side, I get all the wonderful feedback from my students and I feel that<br>
through them I am indirectly accomplishing my club and social dancing when I<br>
cant attend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: How is New York Mambo Dancing different from mambo dancing in other parts of
the country?</font><br>
JC: </b>
To me I dont like to focus on the differences of mambo.&nbsp; There are too
many<br>
people that like to focus on the differences of the dance and of the people.&nbsp;<br>
Lets talk about the similarities.&nbsp; There is enough negativity in this
world &nbsp;<br>
and I especially dont want to see it in mambo.&nbsp;I enjoy dancing and so do
all<br>
the salseros and salseras around the world and I feel that that is the most<br>
important similarity supporting the growth and beauty of the dance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY:
Do you think that dancers get treated with respect? If not why?</font><br>
JC: </b>
Respect is something that you have to earn.&nbsp; It is an unfortunate reality,<br>
but nevertheless, a true one.&nbsp; You have to first and foremost get respect<br>
from your dancing, and then you have to further build on that respect by<br>
displaying a pleasant disposition.&nbsp; Lets see who has established their<br>
respect.&nbsp; <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie</a> and <a href="../instructors/maria_torres.htm"> Maria
Torres</a>, The Vasquez brothers, Seaon Bristol, <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">
Nelson<br>
Flores</a>, Albert Torres, <a href="../instructors/david_melendez.htm"> David
Melendez</a>, and many more.&nbsp; It was through their<br>
constant contribution, creative energy, and supportive attitudes for the<br>
dancers that have established their respects in my mind and in the minds of<br>
thousands.&nbsp; I hope one day I can say millions.&nbsp; For now, <a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm"> Candy and I</a>
are<br>
building on that same formula.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#000080">SNY: What would you like to see happen to mambo within the next few years?, next
decade? within your lifetime?</font><br>
JC:</b>
I would love to see mambo take a more active roll on Broadway and films.&nbsp; I<br>
would love to see myself as a part of that process and I would love to see<br>
more and more individuals take part in the growth of the dance and not the<br>
destruction of the dance.&nbsp; Leave the negativity, jealousy, and hatred home,<br>
and I believe, as I am sure others do that we will accomplish it.&nbsp;<br>
