        <br>
        I have always preferred music with Afro-based rhythms, beginning in high
        school in California with R &amp; B, soul, blues &amp; jazz.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Its the strong complex syncopated beats that move me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>When I came to New York, the Afro-Latino-Caribbean rhythms &amp;
        music became the most enjoyable music for me to listen &amp; dance to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I speak some Spanish and have spent considerable time with Latino
        friends so the topics, emotions and situations expressed in salsa songs,
        and the attitude on the dance floor, are quite familiar to me and
        I can relate to them personally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since
        this is my favorite music, it is only natural that I would want to dance
        to it.</font></span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
        began going to Latin clubs here in NYC in the late 1970s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>For many years, I danced the old side-to-side style with a kick. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        think its what <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> calls lay lo lie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I just learned it in the clubs from watching people and dancing
        with different partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        tried dancing On 1 a few times but I never felt that the timing fit the
        complexity of the rhythms, especially the clave and the tumbao.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I had a good time at some of the old hangouts like Casa Blanca,
        Ochentas, Club Broadway (96<sup>th</sup> &amp; Bway), Side Street,
        Orchard Beach, the old Copacabana on East 60th Street, <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a>
        Socials.but no, not the Palladium.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
        the 1990s I got tired of seeing certain dancers do amazing things on
        the dance floor which I couldnt do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I wanted to dance that way and dance with those partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>So I asked around and discovered that this was called mambo
        breaking On 2 and eventually ended up at <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie
        Torres</a> classes, where I went for about 2 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>After that, I continued for several years in weekly privates with
        2 <a href="../../guide/Performers/Torres.htm">Eddie Torres Dance Company</a> performers, <a href="../instructors/sammy_irizarry.htm">Sammy
        Irizarry</a> and <a href="../instructors/frankie_martinez.htm">Frankie
        Martinez</a>, going 1 year to each of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I also had privates with <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie
        Diaz</a> who taught me cha cha, plus a few classes with <a href="../instructors/thomas_guerrero.htm">Thomas
        Guerrero</a> of <a href="http://www.santorico.com">Santo Rico</a> and <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
        Flores</a> of <a href="http://www.descargalatina.com">Descarga Latina</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        addition to the lessons, I had 3 practice partners over several years
        who very patiently allowed me to bore them to death with my drilling
        turn patterns over and over again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I owe Marilyn Curet, <a href="../../picture_page1.htm#MADELINE">Madeline Cruz</a> and Rocio Paz a lot of
        gratitude for helping me to learn and love this dance.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
        me, dancing mambo breaking On 2 is a method which captures many of
        the complex rhythms that are in classic salsa music.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have written about this<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> more completely, and you can read this by clicking on
        <a href="../../ourdancemusic.htm#Clave">How Dancing On 2 Fits The Music</a> </span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our moves respond to the
        2 downbeats, the clave, the tumbao and the overall uneven syncopation of
        this music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And what is
        really special about the On 2 timing is that the better one gets, the
        more one becomes aware of different rhythms that werent noticed
        before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And also the more
        skilled one becomes, the more one can dance with advanced partners and
        discover the fascination of seeing and feeling how they each respond
        uniquely to the music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amateurs
        watch us dance and say:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
        just a bunch of fancy turns without any relation to the music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Within all those complicated moves are each dancers
        response to the complex syncopated rhythms, the melody and even the
        meaning of the salsa songs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like
        many skilled activities, the better one becomes, the more one can
        perceive and feel the richness of this music &amp; dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>People who reach a certain mediocre level and never strive to
        improve, or move on to another timing or dance, never discover these
        rich pleasures of dancing On 2 to classic salsa music that open up to
        the advanced dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, to
        put this another way, the more one refines their skill, the more one
        enjoys the dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Add to
        all of this, learning more about the salsa music, the Latino culture,
        the food, the people, etc., and how these contribute to the flavor
        of the dance, and theres almost no limit to how much one can enjoy
        dancing On 2.</font></span></p>

        </span>The reason is that one of the things I enjoy most is the

        </span>In performing, dancers memorize a certain set of moves and then
        repeat them over and over, sometimes for years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
        Of all the activities of salsa, including teaching, performing, social 
        dancing, DJing, promoting, web hosting, etc., I believe social dancing
        is the original and most fundamental salsa activity and skill, and it is
        the ultimate test of how much of a salsero one is, and how skilled one
        is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If one can perform a
        series of preset moves up on a stage but cannot social dance well with
        different and new partners, how good a salsa dancer can one be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
        is not to criticize the many different salsa activities people do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are all necessary parts of the world of salsa and they all
        contribute to our dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        lets face it, how many times have we heard:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Hes a good DJ but he cant dance, or Shes a good
        performer but can she really dance?, or He runs a salsa web site,
        but hes not much of a dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>When we say dance, we mean social dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That is the real measure of whether someone can dance.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">However,
        I do like to watch performing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        that case, Im seeing a routine once or maybe a few times and it seems
        fresh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I would never
        want to watch that same routine as many times as those performers are
        rehearsing and performing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor
        would I want to do a particular routine that many times either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>By the way, we have some wonderful performing teams here in the 
        NY/NJ area  Click on our <a href="../../guide/performers1.htm">Directory of 
        Mambo Performers</a>
        .<o:p>

        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally,
        performers should realize that many of their fellow dancers enjoy
        watching them dance in a social dance situation, sometimes even more
        than on stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Theres a
        very good reason for this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        a club or a mambo social or congress, when performers are social dancing
        with different partners, they are dancing to the same music and on the
        same dance floor as the rest of us, but doing it much more impressively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are dancing spontaneously, not following some preset
        rehearsed script, and it is fascinating to watch for all of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>That is REAL dancing!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some
        performers come to an event a few minutes before they go on stage and
        leave a few minutes after.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
        all we know, that little 5 minute routine is all that they can do.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But when performers come and join in the general dancing,
        then go on stage, and then return to the dance floor with all their
        style, technique, flavor, charisma and expertise, we are really
        impressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now we know for
        sure that they can really dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It makes us proud to be a part of a way of dancing that has such 
        an awesome high end, and it inspires us to improve our dancing even 
        more.&nbsp; I believe performers should make it an important part of 
        their role in the mambo community to spend time dancing in the socials 
        and clubs where their fellow mambo dancers hang out.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

        <a href="../instructors/home.htm">Directory of Mambo Instructors</a> . <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Although a few people are
        able to learn to dance On 2 on their own, most people benefit from going
        to classes and taking privates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
        learn faster and they benefit from the instructors wide experience
        and from the practice &amp; familiarity with other students in the
        classes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When they go out to clubs or socials, they can immediately
        start dancing with the people they know from their classes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Its a big advantage.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
        are 2 recommendations I would make to instructors.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The first is that they should make sure that their students
        have mastered good fundamentals before teaching them more advanced turn
        patterns or shines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
        students are trying to do intermediate or advanced moves and yet still
        have not learned the basics:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
        basic step, the timing with the music, the footwork for cross body lead
        and turns, how to lead &amp; follow with a partner, proper etiquette on 
        the dance floor, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Along with this learning the timing with the music, I would
        urge you to help your students to learn how to feel and dance to medium
        and slower speed music.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We know its harder, but thats where the rhythm is at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Yes, students want to rush right away and do the fancy stuff, to 
        super-fast music, but instructors should drill them in the basics until 
        they have mastered them before moving them on to more complicated moves.&nbsp; 
        And of course, social dancing is mainly partner dancing, not open 
        shines, so instructors should concentrate their attention on the 
        fundamentals of partner dancing.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Students, you need to 
        remember that an instructor earns income from teaching classes.&nbsp; If 
        you push your instructor for fancy turn patterns before you may be 
        ready, he/she may teach them to you in order to not lose you as a 
        student.&nbsp; That's just good business by &quot;satisfying the customer&quot;.&nbsp; 
        But you will be hurting yourself by building fancy turn patterns on bad 
        fundamentals, so they will never work well and will look lousy.&nbsp; So 
        take it slow and learn your fundamentals very well first before pushing 
        your instructor to move on too quickly before you are ready.&nbsp; Be 
        patient and drill drill drill.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
        second recommendation I would make to instructors is that they not
        isolate themselves from the social dancing scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One of the reasons that many instructors teach impractical turn
        patterns &amp; shines which cannot be done out in the clubs and socials,
        and cannot be done with a partner who has not been in the same class, is
        that these instructors have lost touch with the social dancing
        community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They remain
        isolated in their own world, or they only dance with a few favorite
        partners who know all their moves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The result is that they are no longer aware of what the dancing
        is like out in the real world of socials &amp; clubs, and what its
        like to dance with many different partners, and in crowded situations
        which limit ones available floor space and possible turn patterns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After
        all, more than 95% of students are in those classes to learn social
        dancing so they can go out and enjoy themselves with many partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They are not there to become future performers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many instructors are teaching turn patterns and shines for
        performers on the stage, but they need to remember that their students
        just want to go out &amp; have fun social dancing in a club or social.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Save the fancy stuff for rehearsals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Since most of your students are there to become good social
        dancers, teach them how to social dance.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also,
        dancing evolves over the months &amp; years, it changes with new dancers
        &amp; new songs on the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instructors
        who dont go out dancing will keep teaching the same old fashioned
        moves that are no longer used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Students
        need to ask the question:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
        my instructor is never out dancing socially, with many different
        partners, in crowded situations with various floor surfaces &amp; music,
        how can he/she be teaching me mambo that I can use out in the real
        world?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When students try
        a complicated move from class at a social or club, and it doesnt
        work, they should wonder if maybe the reason is that its only a
        classroom or performance move, but not a practical move for
        the real world of social dancing, a move that can work when dancing with 
        a stranger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most
        of us have had the experience of learning dance moves in the classroom
        which simply wont work well when were out social dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If our instructors were out there frequently dancing with us in 
        those same places with a variety of partners, they would never try to 
        teach such complicated or difficult to lead moves.&nbsp;
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
        finally, instructors should be out there in the social scene because
        they are the experts, the role models, the experimenters and leaders of
        this dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They set the
        example for students to follow, they demonstrate the good technique
        &amp; musical feeling that students need to learn, and they provide the
        image of what a student can become if he/she continues to work on their
        dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When instructors
        are a regular part of the dancing scene, it is good for the mambo
        community because the students see that everyone is together enjoying
        this dance &amp; music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
        the students who are looking for an instructor can see them in action
        and can choose to attend their classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Being out there in the social dance scene is one of the best ways 
        for an instructor
        to pick up new students.<o:p>

        </span>A dancer friend of mine from San Francisco who visited <a href="jimmy_anton_social.htm">Jimmy

        </span>I would agree in the sense that many dancers now try to do only
        super-fancy turns, shines &amp; style moves, and only want to dance to
        fast music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This kind of
        manic hyperactive showoff dancing is often disconnected from the complex

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
        I disagree that our newer more complex dancing style is without feeling

        it is done in moderation and done skillfully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        with the rhythms or mood of the song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If done well, the music &amp; feeling are right there in the

        styling moves.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        </span>For those who are not Latino, Id like to emphasize that NY

        </span>If you want to capture the real flavor of this dance, you

        suggest learning about and building up a collection of salsa music,
        learning to speak some Spanish, becoming familiar with the local Latino culture

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
        As I mentioned in Question 2 above, NY style On 2 mambo has a special way of
        connecting to certain important rhythms in classic salsa music (clave, tumbao,
        downbeats, etc.) as described at <a href="../../ourdancemusic.htm#Clave">
        &quot;How Dancing On 2 Fits The Music&quot;</a>
        .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is not to say that
        it is any better or worse than other ways of dancing to salsa.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Each one is unique.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
        way we dance NY style mambo On 2 here in New York is the result of the
        many years that this dance has developed, mainly in the unique urban
        culture of New York and Caribbean Latinos who live here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Even though we have <a href="../instructors/home.htm">many
        instructors</a> here who are not Latino, most of them try to teach this 
        distinctive New York/Latino flavor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And when dancers of all origins are out in our clubs &amp;
        socials, they are surrounded by this influence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That gives them a constant exposure to this New York
        style.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
        though there are many NY style On 2 dancers in other parts of the world,
        and their numbers are increasing, it would be rather difficult for them
        to consistently dance with our New York style to the degree that we do
        because they do not have the home-grown New York Latino environment to
        constantly reinforce it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So,
        to answer the question, that is what makes NY mambo dancing so unique
        compared to everywhere else.<o:p>

        many international On 2 social dancers, performers &amp; instructors
        come here for visits and spend lots of time taking classes and going out
        dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have a special 
        section for visiting salsa dancers - click on
        <a href="../resources/visitors.htm">Salsa Dancers Visitors Guide To New 
        York</a> .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, many of the NY
        dancers travel internationally showing and teaching the style.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With this cultural exchange has come a wonderful
        spreading of not only the basic techniques of our dance but also some of
        the New York flavor and attitude which distinguishes our style and
        which we are quite proud of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
        those of us who love this way of dancing, this internationalization of
        the New York style is very gratifying.</font></span></p>
