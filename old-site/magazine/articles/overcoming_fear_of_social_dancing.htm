    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">DOC SALSA'S PEP TALK TO THE TIMID,
    CRANKY AND WORRIED DANCERS - THE FACTS OF LIFE AND A STRATEGY</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've heard a lot of people worrying about
    being at a mambo event when there are some very good dancers in the crowd or on the dance
    floor. They get intimidated, they hang back, they get embarrassed to dance. &nbsp; Some of
    them hang out right over there where the best dancers are doing their thing, just standing
    there and watching and wishing, and feeling inferior, excluded or angry.&nbsp; And some of
    them get upset because they don't get many dances.&nbsp; Sometimes, the people who are
    worrying or intimidated are beginner or intermediate dancers, or dancers who are new to
    our metro mambo scene. They may feel that the crowd is &quot;cliquish&quot; or
    &quot;stuck-up&quot; or &quot;judgmental and critical&quot;.&nbsp; Here are a few thoughts
    on the matter, and some strategies to get you dancing more, having more fun, and bitching
    less.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>WHO DANCES WITH WHOM? - HUMAN NATURE AT WORK</strong>&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most people most of the time choose their
    partners for 2 reasons:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; ability to dance at their <u>level</u> and in their 
    <u>style</u>,
    2) and friendship.&nbsp; And within the dance community, these two often go
    together:&nbsp; one's dancer friends usually dance at a similar <u>level</u> and in a similar
    <u>style</u>.&nbsp; <u>Level</u> refers to one's technical skill.&nbsp; <u>
    Style</u> refers to how one moves their body, their manner, shows their 
    feelings &amp; attitude, shows their masculinity and femininity.&nbsp; For 
    example, here in New York City we refer to an &quot;uptown&quot; and a &quot;downtown&quot; 
    style of dancing mambo On 2.&nbsp; Another example is that some dancers keep 
    their body motions quite clean and simple whereas others do a lot of extra 
    hand and body motions.&nbsp; As mentioned above, NY mambo dancers tend to 
    choose partners whose style is similar to theirs.&nbsp; Partly that's an 
    aesthetic choice and partly it's because people who move their bodies in a 
    similar fashion will be more synchronized in their dancing.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the way, this is also true in other dances like hustle and swing, and in
    sports and many activities where a skill is involved.&nbsp; If you play basketball or
    tennis, you usually play and hangout with&nbsp;friends of a similar level of
    ability.&nbsp; Whether this is right or wrong, fair or unfair, the fact is that it's just
    human nature. &nbsp; Generally, it's not &quot;cliquish or stuck-up&quot;, it's just
    people naturally congregating together who enjoy and share a similar <u>level
    </u>and <u>style</u> of
    dancing, and a friendship involving shared views.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For those who feel excluded, I would simply
    say that if you work your way up in terms of your dancing <u>skills</u> and 
    <u>style</u>, and you hold
    similar views and make friends, most of these so-called &quot;cliques&quot; can eventually
    become the groups you congregate in, if that's what you wish.&nbsp; You can also find out
    what studio they go to or come from, and then go take classes there.&nbsp; This way, you
    become friends with them in classes and learn their particular style, and hang out with
    them at the socials or clubs.&nbsp; My point here is that they are not really
    &quot;cliques&quot; in the sense of being exclusionary, but rather people congregating
    together around shared skills and interests which, incidentally, is called &quot;The Right
    To Free Association&quot; in our U.S. Constitution.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>&quot;IF I GO OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR, PEOPLE WILL SEE I'M NOT THAT GOOD&quot;</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Regarding the worry that some of these very
    good dancers are watching you and are judging and critical, I have bad news and I have
    good news:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; The bad news is that &nbsp; unless you're a really super dancer,
    they're not watching you.&nbsp; You're being ignored.&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; The good news is that
    unless you're a really super dancer, they're not watching you.&nbsp; You're being
    ignored.&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; And if you are a superdancer, and they're watching you with a
    frown on their faces, it's probably because they envy you, and also they're hard at work
    trying to steal your material.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So you don't really have to worry at all
    about them watching you and being critical or judgemental.&nbsp; Think about it:&nbsp; who
    do we really watch on the dance floor?&nbsp; The so-so dancers, or the really good
    ones?&nbsp; The good ones, of course.&nbsp; My point here is that everyone should just
    take every opportunity to dance, practice, learn, and not waste their time worrying&nbsp;
    about who's watching, because they're probably not watching you anyway.&nbsp; Being timid
    and staying off the dance floor is totally counter-productive: you dance less, make fewer
    friends, get less practice, and don't improve as quickly, so it takes you that much longer
    to reach the level you wish you were at, so that people would not look at you critically,
    and in fact would be admiring you and saying:&nbsp; &quot;Wow, so-and-so sure is dancing
    great!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INTIMIDATION OR INSPIRATION?</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's say you're a beginner or intermediate
    dancer and you're standing and watching some really good dancers, and you're feeling
    intimidated and afraid to dance.&nbsp; The problem is not with these really good dancers.
    &nbsp; The problem is in your own head.&nbsp; You are not a victim of those dancers, nor
    of the thoughts in your own mind.&nbsp; It is YOUR mind, YOU control the thoughts in YOUR
    mind. &nbsp; You have a mental CHOICE that you can make:&nbsp; You can CHOOSE to be
    Intimidated, or you can CHOOSE to be Inspired, by these excellent dancers.&nbsp; You can
    CHOOSE to take the attitude that they're great and you're lousy, and that you'd be
    Intimidated and embarrassed to get on the dance floor.&nbsp; Or you can CHOOSE to take the
    attitude that they have some great dancing abilities which someday you can learn, and you
    can use them as Inspiration to learn and grow bit by bit, as you study and practice this
    great dance over the months and years.&nbsp; Intimidation or Inspiration:&nbsp; You're not
    a passive victim, you have the power to actively CHOOSE whether you want to be Inspired or
    Intimidated.&nbsp; Now, which would you rather choose?&nbsp; Which choice would be more
    constructive for your dancing progress, for your self-esteem, and for your dancing
    pleasure?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>THE GEOGRAPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DANCE FLOOR</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's face it, all people are not the
    same.&nbsp; Different people are different.&nbsp; And different people dance
    differently.&nbsp; Furthermore, these different dancers often dance in different areas of
    the dance floor.&nbsp; It's just human nature.&nbsp; Generally, there are areas with
    beginners, other areas with intermediate dancers, and still other areas with the hot
    shots.&nbsp; There are even little sub-areas within these main areas.&nbsp; It's not a
    rule, but it just sort of happens that way, naturally.&nbsp; It's like a cafeteria:&nbsp;
    you eat what you want, when you want, and you sit where you want, with who you want.&nbsp;
    On the dance floor, everyone can make their own choice of how good they want to get, who
    they want to dance with, and where they want to dance on the dance floor, and often it
    breaks down according to ability level and friends.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, sometimes I've noticed beginner and
    intermediate dancers&nbsp; spending hours standing or sitting in the area where all the
    top dancers are dancing, and they're complaining that no one will dance with them, and
    that the good dancers are stuck-up.&nbsp; This is not a constructive or helpful
    approach.&nbsp; Here's a better strategy:&nbsp; As I mentioned above, most people usually
    want to dance at their own level.&nbsp; While it's great, as we're working up, to spend a
    little time watching excellent dancers in order to admire them, or be inspired, or to
    learn new moves and style, it's not realistic to be expecting more than a very occasional
    dance over in that section of the dance floor, until you dance very well.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If we really want to get lots of dancing
    practice, our best strategy is to spend most of our time in the areas where dancers at our
    own level are dancing.&nbsp; Complaining doesn't help;&nbsp; taking action does
    help.&nbsp; Eddie Torres used to tell us:&nbsp; &quot;When you go to a club or social,
    don't dance right away. First, walk around and see who can dance ON 2, and who dances at
    your level, or maybe a little bit above your level, and where they're hanging out.&nbsp;
    Then spend most of your time dancing mostly with them.&nbsp; That way, you get the most
    dancing practice, meet new partners, and have the most fun.&quot;&nbsp; It's the geography
    and&nbsp; psychology of the dance floor, and the sooner you learn it the sooner you'll
    have great evenings dancing.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>STRATEGIES - HOW TO DANCE MORE AND BITCH LESS</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Especially for the beginners and
    intermediates, once you've got the geography of the dance floor figured out, here's how to
    get more dances:&nbsp; LADIES, a lot of us guys may look bold, but we don't like
    rejection, and some of us are just downright punks...with muscles.&nbsp; So we're most
    likely to ask someone to dance if they're right up there standing on the edge of the dance
    floor, especially if they're moving to the music already.&nbsp; We know that she's
    probably going to say &quot;Yes&quot; to a dance.&nbsp; The farther away from this
    position she is, the less likely we figure she is to say &quot;Yes&quot;.&nbsp; For
    example, if she's standing more back in the crowd, or she's sitting down, or she's sitting
    or standing way back from the dance floor, we figure she's much more likely to say
    &quot;No&quot; to a dance, so therefore we don't go over and ask those ladies to dance as
    often.&nbsp; I've seen people sitting way away from the dance floor, or behind rows of
    other people, or behind tables and chairs, and complaining that no one will dance with
    them.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">SO LADIES...</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know we men are supposed to climb the
    highest mountain, and swim the deepest ocean, for that woman of our dreams, but I guess
    over the years we fellas have either become a lot less heroic and romantic, or we have
    just learned to play the odds and the probabilities.&nbsp; So we focus most of our
    attention on the ladies right up by the dance floor.&nbsp; Therefore, here's the best
    strategy for you ladies:&nbsp; if you really want more dances, stand up near the front,
    make yourself more visible, get into moving to the music....ON 2, try a little eye contact
    and a smile (not too much, 'cause you know guys can't handle intimacy!), maybe even give
    the guys a helping hand by asking one at your level to dance, so that others see you want
    to be out there dancing instead of just sitting in a corner.&nbsp; Why do I say &quot;move
    to the music ON 2&quot;?&nbsp; Well, believe it or not, if you're new to our ON 2 mambo
    scene here, and the guys don't know you yet, they will be more likely to ask you to dance
    if they see that you're moving to the music ON 2.&nbsp; Something else to remember: &nbsp;
    If you arrive, leave, and spend the whole evening mostly with one guy, even if he's
    &quot;just a friend&quot;, many possible partners will not approach you to dance because
    they'll think he's your boyfriend and you're sticking with him for the evening.&nbsp; So
    if you want people to ask you to dance, it's best to roam around a bit or hang out with
    different people during the evening so the guys will perceive you as more available.&nbsp;

    <a href="http://www.salsacrazy.com/guideforwomen.htm">Guide For Women - 19 
    Ways To Get Men To Dance With You</a> <br>
    <br>
    <strong>AND FELLAS...</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We have to remember that most ladies who are
    true salseras come to these clubs and socials to dance, not to just sit or stand around
    and be cranky or depressed.&nbsp; We're not talking here about the generic ol' club scene
    here, or a &quot;meet market&quot;.&nbsp; We're talking about the mambo scene.&nbsp; So
    when we're hesitating and timid about asking someone to dance, we need to remember that
    the majority of these ladies really do want to dance....that's why they came.&nbsp; So
    just take action, fellas.&nbsp; And if the lady says &quot;No&quot;, well....we've been
    told &quot;No&quot; many times before and we're still breathing.&nbsp; And there are
    definitely 10 other ladies right nearby who would probably love to say
    &quot;Yes&quot;.&nbsp; And if a lady says &quot;No&quot;, and then 30 seconds later she's
    dancing with another guy, well....what can you do?&nbsp; We all have a right to be choosy,
    and so does she.&nbsp; But it doesn't mean you're a jerk, or that you were wrong to have
    asked her to dance.&nbsp; Just get over it, move on, and ask someone else.&nbsp; Of
    course, there's an important matter of courtesy and respect to remember here:&nbsp; if a
    woman is standing or dancing most of the time with a certain man, which means they might
    be dating, good etiquette and respect requires that you ask the man if he would mind your
    asking the lady for a dance.&nbsp; Here's another author's suggestions; read 
    her <a href="http://www.salsacrazy.com/10tipsformen.htm">10 Tips For Men To 
    Attract More Women To Dance With You</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>NO ONE KNOWS HOW GOOD I CAN DANCE</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sometimes someone is a pretty accomplished
    mambo dancer, but no one knows them yet.&nbsp; They stand over in the area where the other
    good dancers are, but no one thinks they can dance, so no one will dance with them (woman
    or man).&nbsp; Here's a strategy:&nbsp; Find one good dancer who will dance with you, and
    make sure you place yourself and dance right in front of the little crowd you are wishing
    would notice and dance with you.&nbsp; Once they see you can dance well, you'll be out
    there on the floor for the rest of the night.&nbsp; Again, complaining doesn't help;&nbsp;
    taking action does.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><small><font face="Verdana">DON'T GIVE UP!</font></small></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Learning to dance mambo ON 2 takes time and
    work for most of us, and it includes some evenings when you feel you'll never improve and
    when almost no one will dance with you. But if you keep learning, by taking classes or
    privates, drilling the fundamentals and practicing, and getting out there social dancing,
    you will most likely master the dance and come to enjoy the results of all that work: the
    joy of dancing well and being able to dance with many different partners. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>ABOUT DANCING STYLE, AND WHO ARE YOUR DANCER FRIENDS</strong></font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Most people (especially more advanced dancers)
    choose their partners based on ability to dance at their <u>level</u> and in their 
    <u>style</u>, and
    friendship.&nbsp; &quot;<u>Style</u>&quot; involves a lot of things.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp;
    &quot;<u>Style</u>&quot; means how we move, our mannerisms, our clothing, how we feel the rhythms
    of the music and which ones we choose to accent, how we relate to our partners, our dance
    &quot;attitude&quot;, the expression on our faces, how we show the passion and sexuality
    of mambo and its historical Latin culture on the dance floor, and even how we express our
    personal, family and cultural beliefs about leading and following, male and female,
    modesty and showing off, competition and sharing, and other aspects of life.&nbsp; All
    this is visible in our &quot;<u>style</u>&quot; of dancing mambo.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">And &quot;Friendship&quot; is who we've become
    friends with as we've attended classes, socials and clubs.&nbsp; People will always have
    their personal preferences about who they want to dance with, in the same way that people
    have their preferences about who they want to spend time with in other activities. That is
    just plain human nature (in fact it's animal nature too), and also something very
    important called &quot;freedom of choice&quot;.&nbsp; We cannot teach, suggest or
    legislate away human nature and the freedom of personal choices.&nbsp; What that means is
    that some people just don't want to dance with me, or be friendly with me.&nbsp; I try a
    few times, then I shoot them....oops....I mean then I move on.&nbsp; You will have the
    same experiences too. <br>
    <br>
    But there are some strategies available for this problem too.&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; 
    First, don't take it&nbsp; personally.&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; Second, try becoming 
    friends.&nbsp; 3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, if you really admire the way a certain 
    group of people dance, and you'd like to dance <u>with</u> them, it would be 
    helpful to dance <u>like</u> them, in their way: that means their footwork, 
    styling, rhythm, partnering techniques, song preferences, &quot;attitudes&quot;, etc.&nbsp; 
    These qualities make mambo dancers synchronized, and help them share the 
    dance emotionally and have a good time.&nbsp; If you are a woman, watch 
    closely how the women in that group dance; a man should watch the men.&nbsp; 
    Try to incorporate these techniques and attitudes into your dancing.&nbsp; 
    You may be able to learn this on your own, or you may need to take classes 
    or privates where these people do.&nbsp; In any case, allow months or longer 
    to begin to change.&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; Forth, remember that there are no 
    guarantees that certain people will ever want to dance with you, so just 
    accept that, get over it and move on.&nbsp; See the article by Rose, host of
    <a href="http://www.TOSalsa.com">www.TOSalsa.com</a>, about

    How To Fit In &amp; Move Up To Dancing With More Advanced Partners</a>.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">
    <strong>FINAL THOUGHTS</strong></font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">I have received a lot of positive feedback
    from dancers expressing their appreciation for my tackling these typical but sometimes
    unpleasant problems.&nbsp; And in return, I'd like to thank all of you for your feedback
    and helpful ideas to share with others.&nbsp; Now, here's one more suggestion: don't give
    up!</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that's Doc Salsa's pep talk.&nbsp;
    Forget all this silliness about &quot;cliques&quot; and criticism, intimidation and
    neglect, complaining and inaction.&nbsp; Be realistic and take constructive action.&nbsp;
    Now let's all get out there and dance and have a ball.&nbsp; We're there to mambo, not to
    worry about who's watching.&nbsp; So let's just get out and dance, and make the most of
    it!<br>
    <br>
