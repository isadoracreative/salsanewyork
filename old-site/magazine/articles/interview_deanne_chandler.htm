  <p><img border="0" src="articles_images/deanne_hs2.JPG" align="left" width="152" height="206"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This Month we interview
  UK Mambo Instructor <a href="instructors/oot_sai_deanne.htm">Deanne Chandler</a>.<br>
  Deanne has traveled to NY on various occasions to learn the NY style of
  Dancing Mambo. She, along with her partner <a href="instructors/oot_sai_deanne.htm">Sai
  Lee</a> are currently listed in <a href="../instructors/home.htm#outside_ny">SalsaNewYork's
  Out-of-town directory on Mambo Instructors</a>. This year she and Sai
  performed at East Coast Congress up in the Catskills, New York. The two are
  currently teaching a Mambo class in London and have recently opened their <a href="http://www.salsaconnexion.co.uk/">SalsaConnexion</a>
  website. Deanne is a lovely soft spoken mambera who has a passion for dancing.
  This will be her
  second exposure in SalsaNewYork (<a href="instructors/oot_sai_deanne.htm">his
  instructor listing </a>was the first).&nbsp;As usual it was a pleasure dealing
  with her.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
  <b>SNY: What's the Salsa scene like where you live? Is On2 poplar by you? If not,
  what made you decide to teach it there?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>London in general has a very strong well developed Salsa scene, a lot of
  &gt; people have been learning on2 but not really dancing it as much in the general main stream clubs, however that is slowly changing as people
  become more confident and aware of it.&nbsp; In particular if some see others
  dancing
  it, they begin to appreciate it more and want to learn and try it out.&nbsp;
  I
  think this is because London Salseros have largely danced on the 1 and 3,
  initially influenced by the Cuban and Colombian styles, however now there is a lot
  more diversity in the London Salsa scene now with people teaching and dancing<br>
  lots of other styles and with instructors coming over from the US.&nbsp; It is
  good
  to have variety in Salsa, teaching on 2 was a challenge when we first
  started out many people did not dance it, but now things are gradually improving
  with more instructors teaching On2.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: How many classes do you currently teach and what level are these
  classes??</b><br>
  <b><font color="#FF0000">DC:</font></b>  <a href="../instructors/oot_sai_deanne.htm#schedule"> Three nights a week</a> in total currently.&nbsp; They are aimed at all
  levels of dancer.&nbsp; Tuesday is a Salsa/Mambo on 2 Class in Las Brasas (Turnmills)
  in
  the city of London which is from 8:30 - 9:30pm followed by a club until 12pm. Thursday is outside of London in Maidenhead in Berkshire, we teach Salsa
  with beginner/improver <font color="#000080">(editor's note: improver is the equivalent
  to what we in NY call Advanced Beginner)</font> between 7:30-8:30pm, then 8:30-9:30pm int/adv followed by a club
  until 11pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday is a London-based Salsa class taught in
  the Pineapple Dance Studios from 7-9pm.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: Do you have a performance team??? Do you plan to form one?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>We had one previously, but are currently in the throes of working with
  some others on some different projects.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: Have you performed if so name your favorite on stage performance?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>I have performed with my regular dance <a href="../instructors/oot_sai_deanne.htm"> partner Sai
  </a> as well as with
  groups. It is difficult to isolate one as there have many memorable ones,
  nonetheless I would say that one group performance that always stands out in my
  mind
  was with Yurupari in Canterbury Cathedral.&nbsp; It was such an exhilarating experience as it was televised live world-wide at easter with many
  bishops and Cardinals watching as well as Prince Charles, the costumes were very
  traditional ones and we had live Latin musicians and singers that formed
  part of the procession there was such a buzz that day at the end as we all<br>
  danced right through the Cathedral.&nbsp; Another individual show with myself
  and Sai
  was<br>
  a really enjoyable number we did at a venue called the Tabernacle in
  London to celebrate the birthday of a really good friend. The stage setting was
  amazing in the way that it was decorated and the evening was electric
  with
  a great uplifting crowd, there were also live musicians specially brought
  in that night to mark the event.

  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What is it like to learn a choreographed routine?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>It is great fun, though the more people involved sometimes the more
  trickier it can get, nonetheless it is always interesting as you get to dance with
  lots of other individuals, at other times it can be nerve racking if you
  are trying to learn the piece in a limited period of time or if you are
  showing it to other people who are trying to learn it for the first time and are
  new to it.&nbsp; Generally speaking the good thing is that people come
  together to work as a team and can exchange good ideas.&nbsp; I think people tend to
  improve very quickly as dancers when they learn choreography as there is more of
  a discipline involved when you are working with others, being aware of the people around you, as well as with your own individual needs and dance
  steps.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What got you into performing and what was your first time on stage?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>When I was around 9 years old, I used to go to this day Stage school with
  my younger sister Yolande.&nbsp; I remember doing a tap dancing and Cabaret
  number and thinking hey this is really exciting, after that I was hooked, with
  dancing, but it was not until many years later that I got into Salsa and
  not long after met my current dance partner and decided to enter the UK Salsa Dance Championships, which we subsequently won back in 1996.&nbsp; That
  was the first time we had performed one of our 'Salsa pieces' to a choreography
  which was really exciting, innovative and new at that time in UK Salsa<br>
  Competitions, after that we continued to dance and perform with each
  other
  as well as with others.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What did you feel when you first performed live on stage?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>Really excited and exhilarated but also quite nervous initially seeing
  all those eyes staring back in anticipation, however once the music had
  started I seemed to forget about who was watching and just enjoyed the dance.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What advice would you give those just getting into mambo? How can they<br>
  work at getting better at dancing?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>I would say that perseverance is the key and listening as often as
  possible to the music outside class.&nbsp; Everyone has been a beginner at some
  time and remembers how nerve racking it can be when you are starting out.&nbsp; Do
  not compare yourselves to others too much as it can become frustrating.&nbsp;
  It is important to relax and enjoy above all what you do and be accepting of
  what you can do and the progress you have made.&nbsp; It goes without saying
  though, the more you practice and work hard at your dancing the better you will
  become.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: How best could you describe your way of dancing? of teaching? and of
  performing?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>I would say that my dancing has an influence of Jazz, ballet, with some
  New York, Afro-Carribean/Cuban and Colombian flavors to it.&nbsp; When I
  teach it
  is according to the style and rhythm of the music, but in keeping with that style.&nbsp; I get people to listen to the music and feel it, rather than
  just to go through the motions.&nbsp; Sometimes the body movement may differ
  according
  the particular style someone is learning, so they get to learn the importance
  of applying that as well as the more technical aspects of their lead and
  follow. I always demonstrate things from the guys perspective as well as
  from the<br>
  ladies, and make it a point to dance with the male students as well as
  often as possible during the class as well as in the clubs so they can practice
  steps they have learned.&nbsp; I believe people pick things up quicker
  that
  way. However I am also aware that it is important for men to have a male role model as there will sometimes be elements that a man may put across
  differently from a woman and vice versa.&nbsp; Which is why I also teach
  in a partnership as well as on an individual basis.&nbsp; When performing a
  lot
  depends on the theme and feel of the piece, what I am trying to achieve and the
  style I intend to use.&nbsp; Sometimes it can be for example a Salsa/Mambo on
  2, at other times a Cha Cha Cha.&nbsp; Some tracks I feel instinctively on the
  2,
  others on the 1or 3, a lot depends on the pace and feel of the music.
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: Do you still like to go to clubs and dance
  socially?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, two weekly ones where I also teach .&nbsp; At other times I enjoy
  going
  out at the weekends every now and then as I have more time to relax in
  between and I can also really prepare to go out.&nbsp; Also I do not have to
  worry
  about getting up early the next day for work, furthermore I am rested and have
  not had to go straight from work or something.&nbsp;
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: How is Mambo dancing where you live different from mambo dancing in other
  parts of the world?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>I do not think that there is too much difference, in the way it is danced
  here, as people have become more accustomed to it and appreciate much
  more the wealth of styles in Salsa.&nbsp; I suppose the main thing about Mambo
  is it will naturally be much more developed where many dancers, particularly in
  the US have been teaching and exposed to it for a lot longer.&nbsp; Just as
  say
  London has traditionally been largely&nbsp; influenced by the Cuban and
  Colombian
  styles. There also seems to be a variety of ways of breaking on 2 in the
  US, for example some use the <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie Torres</a> timing of breaking on 2, others the palladium 2 and then some men break back on 6 instead of forward and so
  on. As far as I know there is an interesting strong developing Mambo scene in Japan, Italy and Holland and I am certain that as time goes on it will
  continue to develop even more throughout Europe as well as the rest of
  the world.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What would you like to see happen to mambo within the next few years?,<br>
  next decade? within your lifetime?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>From a UK perspective I would like to see Mambo danced in all the main
  stream clubs, perhaps more On 2 socials in the UK to encourage people to dance
  more. More media coverage, and perhaps west end shows featuring Salsa and
  Mambo Dancers.&nbsp; I would love all the prejudices and politics surrounding
  dancing On2 to disappear particularly in open Salsa competitions, whether or not
  there is a large contingent of 1 or 3 dancers as it will not encourage
  people to go along let alone enter.&nbsp; Even though this is beginning to
  happen,
  that the teachers and promoters within the UK would communicate and work more closely together in future to promote more unity within Salsa and mambo
  in the UK and perhaps to see more congressos being held over here.

  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: Where did you learn to Dance NY style On2??? (Where did you learn to
  Dance<br>
  On2)??<br>
  </b>
  </font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">DC:</font></b><font color="#FF0000"> </font>In the early stages I initially took classes with
  <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie Torres</a>
  and <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm"> Nelson Flores</a> and later had the great pleasure
  </font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of meeting <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm"> Addie
  Diaz-Siverio</a> and Manny who have both been a great support, inspiration and
  encouragement with my dancing as well as being two really genuine friends along with
  other <a href="../instructors/home.htm"> NY and NJ instructors</a> I have had the pleasure of learning from.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: Where did you originally learn how to dance mambo and who was (were)<br>
  your mentors?</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font></b> I first learned ballroom mambo at the Imperial Society of
  Teachers of Dance in London between the ages of 12-14 years old, then
  later from my partner Sai Lee.&nbsp; My mentors were originally my partner <a href="../instructors/oot_sai_deanne.htm"> Sai</a>
  for a while, who inspired me a lot, then later I would say my New York mambo mentors were;
  <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie Torres</a> who was always so patient, attentive and would
  always take time to talk to me.&nbsp;<a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm"> Addie Diaz</a> is an absolute gem and
  real inspiration for my dancing &amp; styling on 2 as well as <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm"> Nelson Flores</a>
  who I always remember as being a great help in my on2 New York Mambo.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What is it like to teach On2 Mambo where you're at????<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>Great.&nbsp; It is an excellent air-conditioned venue with a good
  spacious
  dance floor which attracts a lot of good quality dancers, people are really receptive to learning on 2, they pick up quickly, dance, socialise and
  are patient with everyone even those that are newcomers to Salsa.&nbsp; In
  general there is a good friendly crowd who are fun to hang out with, all the
  teachers are very close and the music is good.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What do you like most about teaching?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>I love the interaction with people.&nbsp; You get to meet the most
  fascinating, interesting and diverse groups of people by having this one major theme
  in common - Salsa.&nbsp; Seeing people progress to become good dancers is
  really motivating and fulfilling.&nbsp; I&nbsp; enjoy helping people
  individually as well
  as those in the class with any queries they may have.&nbsp; I like people
  with a sense of humour who can have a laugh at times, as well as take things seriously when the need arises.&nbsp; Seeing people forming friendships
  both during and after a class is really encouraging as well as the way people
  look after each other and interact outside of Salsa.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: Why do you think people come to learn from you?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>A lot of people come through word of mouth.&nbsp; I am very thorough and
  meticulous when it comes to detail but am also fairly laid back and
  patient with people.&nbsp; I try to have fun as it is just as important to play
  hard as well as work hard.&nbsp; Sometimes I am very straight and direct but I
  always
  make an effort to get to know people and spend time with them as often as I
  can, sometimes when the time permits after a class and during the club I may
  run over things if people still need help.&nbsp; I always treat people as
  individuals I think they appreciate this.&nbsp; I know I did when I was new to Salsa.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: What is the hardest thing you find about teaching?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC: </font></b>The schedule can sometimes be grueling, particularly if you have another
  job and you may want time out.&nbsp; This is where you need to strike a
  balance between working and taking the occasional break to recharge your
  batteries. Also sometimes you may not always find the people you need to cover
  classes, this is where you need to plan things well in advance if possible.
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: Do you still like to go to clubs and dance socially? Answered already
  How about performing? Do you still perform and who have you performed</font> </b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>for or with?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font> </b>I perform fairly regularly with my partner Sai Lee most recently in a
  dance theatre in London which also featured other acts which consisted of contemporary dancers &amp; Jazz singers, the Salsa went down like a
  scream.
  In the past I have performed with Los Gonzales a Cuban dance Co. Yurupari a Colombian Dance Co.&nbsp; Dance of Life Contemporary gospel dance group
  and the Salsa World Dance Co. a group choreographed by myself and partner Sai.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY: Have you ever choreographed a
  routine?<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">DC:</font></b> Yes, it can be a lot of fun but hard work, you have to be disciplined but
  patient as sometimes people need time to assimilate material.&nbsp; It is
  exciting and fulfilling when you watch after so much hard work people dancing a
  routine together really well.&nbsp; I think that as a choreographer you
  are
  aware of the abilities and talents that each member of your team has and what
  they can contribute to that effort according to the number you are working on
  and encourage them wherever possible but at the same time ensuring that each individual acts professionally and responsibly to each other.
