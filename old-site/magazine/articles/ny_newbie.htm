</font><font face="Verdana" size="3">A Beginner's Mambo Experience in the Big
Apple</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">- by Jill Nightingale</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me be straight with you: I'm
new to salsa.&nbsp; Only been dancing a year, and love it, though I'm no amazing
grace.&nbsp; I've learned diligently to dance &quot;on the one&quot;, never
knowing there was anything else.&nbsp; So, at the Los Angeles Salsa Congress in
May, I was astounded to see East Coast dancers<br>
dancing <a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com/ourdancemusic.htm#DEFINITION">&quot;on
two&quot;</a>, and I was inspired.<br>
<br>
There's a noticeable difference when the &quot;twosters&quot; step forward,
right on the clave, with a &quot;pah&quot;! then back again, &quot;pah&quot;!
What passion those dancers ooze.&nbsp; Not the west coast LA &quot;flash&quot;
(which is beautiful, sure) but the deep down soul that you see in MAMBO, rather
than the salsa I'd been<br>
learning for the last year in hometown, San Francisco.&nbsp; The rumor in&nbsp;
California was: The two is very very hard for someone who dances on one...
Anyway, how would I ever learn the two in California?<br>
<br>
Little did I know I was in for a little one-on-one with the two sooner than
expected:&nbsp; I found I was going to New York City for a week on business, and
would have a LOT of free time on my hands.&nbsp; Could I potentially meet <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">the
Mambo King himself, Eddie Torres</a>?&nbsp; Certainly I would try.<br>
<br>
Salsaweb was the hub of my search for a New York City Mambo lesson &quot;on
two&quot;.&nbsp; Quickly navigating the site, I zipped to the very well kept New
York section and found that <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie
Torres</a> taught open <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm#class">group
lessons</a>--&nbsp; was this possible?!&nbsp; The King himself? And not so far
from my hotel in midtown, too! Clearly it was meant to&nbsp; be; I set out for
the afternoon group lesson.<br>
<br>
<b>The King Lives<br>
</b>For a Californian, the event of <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm#directions">visiting
Eddie Torres</a> at the dance studio was an experience unto itself.&nbsp; The
building was non-descript, just an address on a busy street.&nbsp; There was a
gaggle of dancers on two floors-- downstairs for Beginners, upstairs for
Intermediate.&nbsp; (Obviously, I thought<br>
to myself, I'm not a &quot;beginner&quot;,&nbsp; having taken a year of salsa on
the west coast-- so I skipped up to the intermediate class.)&nbsp; This was akin
to entering the movie, Flash Dance. The only thing missing was the &quot;What a
feeling...&quot; sound track.<br>
<br>
These dancers were good, really good-- warming up, stretching in their dance
duds.&nbsp; I began to feel very nervous in my white tennis shoes and gym
shorts.&nbsp; <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm#review">Then the
lesson started</a>, and it got bad very fast for me.&nbsp; While everyone in the
class stepped forward on the two, I was already coming back from the one (since
the one was the only thing I knew.)&nbsp; The class was crowded and there was no
room for directional blunders like mine.&nbsp; This happened repeatedly until I
had to come to terms with the reality of the situation: I mistakenly thought I
could just learn the two on the fly--<br>
since there was no one to show me the step.&nbsp; But the simple shift from the
one to the two makes a big difference in the look and feel of the dance, and the
warm promise of&nbsp; the Eddie Torres group lesson turned into a cold reality
of a bungling for yours truly.&nbsp; I retreated to plan another calculated
attack on the two.<br>
<br>
On to Plan B--&nbsp; Beg for a private lesson to have someone show me the two,
and with only five days left in NYC.&nbsp; I called Eddie's wife, Maria, who is
clearly his loving and supportive soulmate.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, Eddie was
booked solid. Maria graciously gave me the names of a few of his students.<br>
I called this list, plus some more from Salsaweb's list of private instructors.&nbsp;
Two shining gold stars came through in the form of <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie
Diaz</a> and Angel Ortiz, one private lesson per person.&nbsp; And these two
wonderful people represent a tremendous rebound in my learning curve and ego
with their warm patient teaching styles.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Girl School</b><br>
<a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie Diaz</a> was the first to walk me
through the two, and I will always be grateful to her.&nbsp; She was a delight
to know, and offered instruction that often completely contradicted the lessons
I'd taken in California.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/workshop_teaching_style.htm">Taking
a lesson from a woman</a> is a great experience for a female, because you can<br>
learn the cute and sexy touches that go with the steps which male teachers may
not know, notice, or teach.&nbsp; Addie showed me several steps, drilled them
again and again and when the lesson was over, wrote the steps down for me, beat
by beat, so I could practice on my own.&nbsp; Addie also pointed out some
fundamental problems with what I'd learned at home, which was decidedly more
Cuban.&nbsp; For example, the &quot;kick step&quot; on four is pase, she
explained, simply old fashioned.&nbsp; So I de-learned that on the spot. Next,
the slight out turn of my feet, which I had specifically been taught to do, was
just downright bad form, and so that was immediately removed from my muscle
memory, too.&nbsp; What Addie replaced my misinformation with were: The Suzy Q,
Side Taps, and the Kick Pivot-- Great steps, great experience, great teacher.&nbsp;

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Man Power<br>
</b>Angel Ortiz has been teaching and dancing for a long time-- and it shows. He
has an extraordinary resume of experience; a veteran performer and competitor,
an <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> protégé, and
very good. Angel was the second lesson I took in New York, and this time I wised
up and brought a video camera to capture all the skill and technique I miss when
I'm trying to tell my right foot from my left.&nbsp; Angel was amazingly nice, a
powerful dancer and teacher and he drilled, drilled, drilled a few advanced
steps with me, building on what I'd learned from Addie.&nbsp; Patiently but
firmly, he told me to stop going back to the safety of the basic step and
practice practice a more complex cha cha-inspired step.&nbsp; He also showed me
some syncopated steps that looked impossible at the time-- but now that I've
watched them on video, I can actually do them. (Wouldn't he be proud!)&nbsp;</font></p>

<b>Jill Nightingale</b> is a so-so salsa dancer from San Francisco who
constantly<br>
finds herself in over her head in dance class. Nevertheless, she perseveres<br>
because she loves Latin Dance and will eventually be able to get through an<br>
Eddie Torres Intermediate class.
