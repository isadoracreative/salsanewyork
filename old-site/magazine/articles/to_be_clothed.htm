<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana">In
response to <a href="articles/good_dancing.htm">Joe Weider's article entitled
&quot;Good<br>
Dancing, or Whatever?!&quot; </a>I must first start by<br>
commending him for taking on the controversial issue<br>
of blatant sexual costumes and choreography within<br>
salsa routines.&nbsp; I'm sure Joe's intent was sincere<br>
when he expressed his &quot;anger&quot; towards choreographers<br>
and promoters for apparently encouraging these women<br>
to portray themselves as &quot;sex toys&quot;.&nbsp; However, the<br>
issue is just that - these women were not forced, but<br>
rather voluntarily wore the costumes and gladly<br>
performed the sexually explicit routines.<br>
<br>
Let me rewind - I am a woman who just recently started<br>
looking for my own performance costumes and have been<br>
keeping Joe's little comments floating in the back of<br>
my mind the entire time. The question that was<br>
conjured up the most was &quot;Should the sexy, often scant<br>
wardrobe of salsa costumes be censored?&quot;&nbsp; No. Period.<br>
Dance is an art form of the BODY.&nbsp; I cannot count the<br>
number of times I have seen &quot;scantily&quot; dressed<br>
professional dancers performing with practically<br>
nothing on - such as a performance at City Center from<br>
the &quot;Ballet Folklorico de Bahia&quot; where the women were<br>
all topless, wearing nothing but straw skirts which<br>
conveniently revealed g-strings underneath as a quick<br>
turn or high kick was executed.&nbsp; Or the time I was in<br>
Cuba with the Compania de Danza Narciso Medina where<br>
all the men wore teenie tiny g-strings which seemed to<br>
leave nothing to the imagination, or the Alvin Ailey<br>
male dancers who are also (un)dressed similarly.&nbsp; I<br>
can go on and on.&nbsp; But that is not what these<br>
companies are known for, and their garb is not the<br>
first image that is conjured up.<br>
<br>
These are known dance companies who are well<br>
respected, and not many people consider their dress<br>
inappropriate or vulgar.&nbsp; This is not an environmental<br>
thing, a cultural thing, but rather a conceptual thing<br>
- they understand the difference between accentuation<br>
and domination. The body should accentuate the ability<br>
of the dancer and the brilliance of choreography, not<br>
dominate. The body is a tool which executes art<br>
(albeit &quot;moving&quot; art) just as a painter uses a brush<br>
or a sculptor uses his hands. Although a more<br>
integrated tool, the body 's costume should not<br>
dominate the art of form and choreography. If all the<br>
audience remembers after the performance is the<br>
wardrobe, then the dancer has failed as an artist.<br>
<br>
So when Joe says that there seems to be growing<br>
tendency of salsa performances to have their women<br>
dancers provocatively dressed, perhaps they are not<br>
interested in having their ability and choreography<br>
dominate their exterior appearance. If anything, they<br>
have succeeded in entertaining, which is fine as well.<br>
(But even then if only bare entertainment is offered,<br>
then the least they can do is drop the double standard<br>
and have the men in shredded clothes and thongs as<br>
well.....but that's another issue.)&nbsp; The point is that<br>
a performer should decide before-hand how he/she wants<br>
to be portrayed, and the audience member shouldn't<br>
assume that everyone wants to emphasize dancing. You<br>
would think; however, that dance studio owners would<br>
know that the crowd which gathers at these dance<br>
studio performances expects to see artists in their<br>
element rather than entertainers in their skin.<br>
Unfortunately that is not always the case, and that is<br>
the risk audience members should take - because no<br>
show is guaranteed to please.<br>
<br>
Let's face it, using sex and sexuality is a brainless<br>
way to market. Sex sells everything from cars to<br>
laundry detergent, and what divides the line between<br>
appropriate and obscene is completely subjective.<br>
Ladies, it is up to you to voice how you want to be<br>
portrayed (or market yourselves) when you are up there<br>
on stage:&nbsp; respected as a dancer in your element or<br>
seen for nothing more than your attire.&nbsp; Look, we know<br>
salsa is sexy as all hell and our<br>
costumes/choreography should reflect that.&nbsp; It is when<br>
they dominate and not accentuate that it becomes an<br>
issue for me, not only as an audience member but as a<br>
dancer.<br>
<br>
So if you are thinking about performing, take into<br>
consideration what you deem appropriate and take<br>
control over how you want to be portrayed so that no<br>
one can place blame on your choreographer or your<br>
promoter - because ultimately the responsibility<br>
should be placed on you.&nbsp; That is not to say that you<br>
should be shy about wearing what makes you feel sexy -<br>
wear it, flaunt it, indulge in it.&nbsp; You are a dancer,<br>
use your body as your tool (you too, gentlemen, women<br>
aren't the only ones who should be wearing sexy<br>
costumes ya know.).&nbsp; So go ahead - feel confident<br>
about your appearance but also, more importantly, your<br>
dancing, and know you can't please everyone with what<br>
you 're wearing.&nbsp; Just remember to leave a cloud of<br>
dust in their faces as you zoom by burning a hole in<br>
the dance floor - and perhaps even leave behind a<br>
piece of clothing or two to hang on their disapproving whispers.<o:p>
