        It is a common practice among salsa dance instructors, to have the
        students<br>
        switch partners frequently during the class in order to get them used to<br>
        dancing with different partners.&nbsp; As a beginner student I found
        this<br>
        practice, at least the way it is generally done,&nbsp; counterproductive
        and<br>
        frustrating.<br>
        <br>
        Every time I was learning a turn in any class I took, just when my
        partner<br>
        and I where beginning to &quot;get it,&quot; the instructor would switch
        partners and I<br>
        would find myself right back at the beginning.&nbsp; If my new partner
        was behind<br>
        in learning the turn, or her style or sense of rhythm was different from
        my<br>
        previous partner's, or my own, this would throw me off and render any<br>
        progress I made before of little use.&nbsp; I needed time to synchronize
        with this<br>
        new person.<br>
        <br>
        The instructor usually continued where he/she left off before the
        switch,<br>
        ignoring the conflict created by it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, my new partner and
        I, now<br>
        more focused on adapting to each other's style and understanding of the
        turn<br>
        than on what the instructor was saying, would fall behind on the
        instruction<br>
        and eventually find ourselves pretty lost.<br>
        <br>
        I tried taking an intermediate class, to see if dancing with a more
        advanced<br>
        partner would help, but I couldn't keep up, the pace was too fast for
        me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I<br>
        went to several classes with 3 different instructors, all well known and<br>
        reputable, hoping to find one that would do it differently.&nbsp; They
        all did it<br>
        the same way.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I think that a better way for instructors to do the partner switch, is
        by<br>
        allowing the students to learn one complete turn with the same partner,
        and<br>
        then, when they start teaching a new turn, have them switch partners.&nbsp;
        This<br>
        way the instructor is not adding one more difficulty to the already
        difficult<br>
        task of understanding and memorizing a turn.<br>
        <br>
        Being able to dance with different partners is, obviously, important,
        but for<br>
        a man to adapt to a new partner's style, he must be able to lead her,<br>
        something he cannot do&nbsp; when he is still learning the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And for a<br>
        woman to adapt to a new partner, she must also be familiar with the
        steps, so<br>
        that she can understand what her partner is trying to do, and follow.&nbsp;<br>
        Because of this, it seems to me that people who already know how to
        dance are<br>
        the ones who can&nbsp; benefit the most from the experience of dancing
        with<br>
        different partners.&nbsp; People who are trying to learn how to dance
        are,<br>
        instead, hindered by it, since they are, in practice, trying to learn
        two<br>
        things at the same time.<br>
        <br>
        I personally think that the ideal way to learn how to dance is by
        practicing<br>
        with the same partner, this way the couple can quickly adapt to each
        other's<br>
        style, their level of ability will be matched, and their progress will
        be<br>
        even.&nbsp; This frees their minds to focus entirely on learning the
        steps, and<br>
        they learn better.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        However, dance classes where one is not required to bring a partner,
        allow<br>
        many more people to participate, and&nbsp; make it easier for the
        instructor to<br>
        run a full class, since it does not require continuity but, instead, it
        can<br>
        always accommodate new students of different levels and contain full<br>
        instruction on a variety of things.&nbsp; That's why this type of class
        is more<br>
        desirable for students as well as instructors and, therefore, more
        popular.<br>
        <br>
        I must add here that I am not a true beginner, and that I actually have
        an<br>
        advantage over the average beginner:&nbsp; I was born and raised in
        Cuba, where I<br>
        learned the basic steps of Salsa dancing very early.&nbsp; It is turns
        that I<br>
        never bothered to learn.&nbsp; I am also a musician, and have played
        Salsa<br>
        professionally for years.&nbsp; Understandably, I have no problem at all
        picking<br>
        up floor shines, basic steps, or anything that I can do without a
        partner.<br>
        <br>
        I have stopped taking classes, and have been learning from videos
        instead,<br>
        with a friend.&nbsp; Though videos are an effective tool to learn how to
        dance,<br>
        they are not nearly as motivating as being in a class.&nbsp; Dancing is
        a social<br>
        activity, and being around other dancers is half the fun.<br>
        <br>
        I welcome any feedback on the opinions that I have expressed here.&nbsp;
