  <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Note:</b> You've heard of the old movie titled
  American in Paris, well this is our little Salsa version titled A New Yorker
  in Tampa or (What its like for a NY dancer visiting the Tampa Salsa scene.</font>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="5">A New Yorker in Tampa&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
  </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">- by Natalia Rodriguez</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While I was in Tampa, I had the opportunity
  to visit Ybor City, Tampa's Latin Quarter, and one of its hottest night clubs,
  Club 1509. (Ybor City was named after a Cuban cigar manufacturer, Don Vincent
  Martinez Ybor. The city was born when he moved his factory from Cuba to Tampa
  in 1885.) I was advised to arrive early to avoid the heavy traffic and a mad
  search for parking. The main strip is approximately nine blocks long. The
  streets are closed on Friday and Saturday evenings.&nbsp; This allows visitors
  a leisurely stroll to their dining or night club destination.</font></p>
  <font size="2" face="Verdana">Traffic and parking proved not to be a problem.
  We arrived at approximately 8:30 PM. Latin Quarter, to me, suggested Latin
  food, so we searched along Seventh Avenue for a Cuban restaurant. We
  discovered that Ybor City does not have many Cuban restaurants. We located
  three. Two closed after lunch. The third was too expensive. We settled for
  Carmine's. Its menu listed hamburgers, pasta, and surprisingly, rice and
  beans. Since, my heart was set on Latin food I had the (bland) rice and beans
  with pork and my friend, Angie, had pasta. Other than the rice and beans,
  nothing about this restaurant suggested we were in a Latin Quarter. After the
  meal, as I made my way along a long corridor to the ladies room, the sound of
  a spicy Cha Cha playing increased in volume. My feeling of disappointment
  ceased. The sound entered through an open door leading to a courtyard. The
  courtyard was an outdoor bar with a stage and dance floor. Unfortunately, the
  music was not live. Two couples danced. They were doing something that looked
  somewhat like Swing or the Lindy Hop. The music lightened my mood and reminded
  me of the next stop, <b>Club 1509</b>. It was voted the best for Salsa and
  Merenge, according to the local radio advertisements and Salsaweb. It is
  located a short distance from the restaurant, on Eighth Avenue between Fifteen
  and Sixteenth Street. This was the end of my third week in Florida without
  Salsa. I was ready to dance.</font>
          <p>
  <font size="2" face="Verdana">We arrived at Club 1509 at approximately 10:30
  PM. The wait on line was short. Carding at the door was necessary. You can
  hear both the Salsa and Merenge from outside. The salsa sound exited the club
  through a speaker set above a door. The Merenge played in the bar lounge we
  entered. Our bags were not searched nor did we pass through any noticeable
  metal detector. The cover charge was three dollars.&nbsp; We followed the
  sound of salsa music. It led us to the larger part of the club and the main
  dance floor. There were people standing along the bar and others sat at the
  tables. We managed to grab the last table. It was the only table on the dance
  floor. One of the most conspicuous spots in the club. It proved to be a good
  choice for two single women. We did not wait very long for partners.</font>
          <p>
  <font size="2" face="Verdana">On the dance floor was one couple. They did not
  dance on any particular timing nor were their basic steps familiar. After a
  couple of songs, another couple stepped on to the dance floor. Their style was
  familiar and pleasant to watch. They broke on the one beat and danced in the
  style used in the Cuban dance La Rueda or Casino. The arms are tight. The
  turns are quick. The couple frequently swap places with each other. I hope you
  get the picture. I gather you are familiar with Casino. You might have seen it
  in Miami or here in New York at the bar restaurant, Louisiana, or maybe
  Nell's. As the evening progressed, several couples joined together to
  performed La Rueda. The moves were basic, but it looked good. The Casino
  dancers gathered in one small section of the dance floor. The remainder of the
  floor filled with guest doing the basic box and salsa step. A fair number kept
  the rhythm. Some broke on the one beat. The others broke on whatever beat they
  desired. <a href="../instructors/home.htm">Breaking on two does appear to be a
  New York or professional tradition.</a></font>
          <p>
  <font size="2" face="Verdana">Casual is the preferred choice in Tampa. The
  most popular attire for the men is blue jeans, a shirt, and sneakers. The
  ladies, as is typical, dressed in a variety of styles, but none wore evening
  dresses. I believe the average age of the guest fell in the mid-twenties,
  young and good looking. They displayed a pleasant nature and friendly
  attitude.&nbsp; One of the better dancers present ask a young lady to dance.&nbsp;
  He tried to lead her, but soon gave in to her lead. He started to moving as
  erratically as she did. Together they made up a fun pattern and enjoyed the
  rest of the dance.&nbsp; He asked her to dance once more.&nbsp; Then he
  escorted her back to her friends. . Good manner was the only formality I
  observed.&nbsp; Every man I danced with escorted me back to my table</font>
          <p>
  <font size="2" face="Verdana">I enjoyed my Club 1509 experience. The
  atmosphere was relaxed and unpretentious. The music was good. My Salsa
  partners weren't bad. They kept the rhythm and there were one or two good
  moves. <b>I recommend the club, but to a woman, who only dances breaking on
  the two beat or likes a lot of turns, I will suggest she leave her dancing
  shoes home or take a partner. </b>The men will have an easier time finding a
  good partner if they know how to dance Casino.</font>
