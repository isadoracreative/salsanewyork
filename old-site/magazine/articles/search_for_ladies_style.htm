        Videos And My Search For Style<br>
        </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">&nbsp;- by Rene Luthe</font></p>
        <font SIZE="2">
        <p><font face="Verdana">What made me fall in love with salsa dancing was
        not the percussion that virtually defines Latin music. As irresistible
        and exciting as I find that, what made me totally lose my heart to salsa
        was the no-holds-barred <i>femininity</i> that belongs to the woman's
        part in Latin dance. I grew up in a non-dancing culture, and at a time
        when feminism was advocating that women wear sensible shoes, trousers,
        and no make-up (in other words, if you want people to think you have a
        brain, appear more like a man!). So I guess it was inevitable that the
        sensual, flirty gestures of salsa touched  no, make that <i>electrified</i>
         something primal in me. The rolling hips, the shimmying shoulders,
        the tossing hair  one look and I became a hopeless ladies' styling
        junkie!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Well, in my quest to acquire styling, I was
        willing to canvass the country, but annoying little realities such as my
        job soon got in the way. It became clear that instructional videos
        would, for the most part, have to suffice. But as we all know, those
        videos have some drawbacks: often, you are buying a product with no idea
        if you'll like it, and at $20 to $30 each, shots in the dark are
        expensive. So in the interest of helping my fellow salseras achieve
        jaw-dropping feminine allure on the dance floor, I decided to review
        three of the most popular ladies' styling videos currently on the
        market: <a href="http://www.salsawebmall.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=SWMall&amp;Category_Code=JSN-CAT"> Jose Neglia's Latin Style and Technique for
        Ladies</a>, <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/videos.htm"> Addie Diaz's
        Beginner Ladies' Styling</a>, and <a href="../instructors/razz_m_tazz.htm"> Addie Rodriguez's (Razz M'
        Tazz)
        Salsa/Mambo Ladies' Styling Workshop</a>. The following evaluations were
        made with the beginner-to-intermediate level dancer in mind.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <b>
          <p><font face="Verdana"><font face="verdana,  arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="articles_images/josie-box.jpg" align="left" width="56" height="100"></font>Josie Neglia's Latin Style and Technique for
          ladies (approximately 25 min.):</font></b><font face="Verdana"> To
          teach correct technique for Latin dance, Neglia begins at the
          beginning  that is, she provides the viewer with explanations and
          exercises in elemental concepts, such as Latin and contra-body motion.
          Posture, finger placement and how to spot during turns are also
          covered, as are exercises in isolating the various parts of the body
          used in salsa. Neglia then demonstrates basic turns and ends with a
          few shine, or solo steps. Her instructions are specific and thoroughly
          explained.<br>
          </font><b><font face="Verdana">What's in it for you?</font></b><font face="Verdana">
          The instructions in the basics of Latin dance that Neglia provides
          give the viewer a good solid foundation  and for Neglia, that
          foundation starts with the dancer's feet before she works her way
          upward. This emphasis makes the video a great one for beginners.
          Thanks to the clear instructions, implementing Neglia's teachings is
          easy and will immediately improve your appearance on the floor.
          Especially valuable is an excellent exercise in spotting during turns,
          usually a tricky thing for new dancers to get the hang of. The segment
          on shine steps is perhaps less helpful. It's not just that only a few
          are covered, it's that they are presented in a hurried manner, only
          broken down twice, without a close-up of the feet. To me, that segment
          had a haphazard feel to it, as if the steps were just odds and ends
          thrown in to use up the remaining tape. Another problem with the
          shines is that they are presented without music, so the viewer doesn't
          learn how to properly execute them to rhythm. The &quot;bloopers&quot;
          at the end of the tape don't contribute to improving the viewer's
          dancing, either.<br>
          </font><b><font face="Verdana">Last take:</font></b><font face="Verdana">
          The video does a good job in providing the instruction in technique
          and posture that the beginning dancer usually needs.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana"><font face="verdana,  arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/videos.htm"><img border="0" src="articles_images/addie-box_temp_th.gif" align="left" width="57" height="100"></a></font>Addie Diaz's &quot;On '2' with Addie-Tude,
          Volume 1: Beginner Ladies' Styling&quot; (approximately 45 min.): </font></b><font face="Verdana">Diaz
          presents basic shines with accompanying styling. Each shine is
          carefully broken down and demonstrated several times as Diaz narrates
          instruction on arm styling, then music is added and the shine is
          practiced to rhythm. The first half of the video is punctuated by a
          routine in which all the shines covered thus far are strung together;
          again, first the routine is practiced slowly to a count, then music is
          added. The video ends with another such routine, in which all the
          shines taught in the video are practiced.<br>
          </font><b><font face="Verdana">What's in it for you?</font></b><font face="Verdana">
          Since Diaz teaches styling to accompany specific shines, the viewer
          has something concrete to do with all that pretty arm motion and
          hair-stroking she's learned. Diaz's instructions are very precise,
          with the camera providing close-ups of the feet and torso to
          illustrate. Another thing I liked about this video is that each shine
          is practiced to music before moving on to the next one  after all,
          memorizing footwork is one thing, but your body doesn't really
          &quot;know&quot; a step until it's performed to music. This way, the
          shine is more thoroughly learned, styling and all, before new material
          is added. The beginner may be intimidated by the first shine Diaz
          presents (it requires three bits of styling performed
          simultaneously!), but don't be discouraged  the steps after are a
          little less daunting, and build gradually in complexity. Where this
          video may be a little confusing for the new salsera is in its lack of
          explanation about a Latin-dance basic, contra-body motion. While Diaz
          refers often to it, no definition or breakdown was provided. For those
          of us who've grown up in one of the &quot;stiff upper-body&quot;
          cultures and haven't much practice in coordinating the movements of
          the shoulders with those of the feet, this absence could be somewhat
          frustrating. A few moments spent on explanation of the concept, plus
          an isolating exercise, would have been helpful.<br>
          </font><b><font face="Verdana">Last take:</font></b><font face="Verdana">

          right now, this video is for you.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana"><font face="verdana,  arial" size="2"><a href="../instructors/razz_m_tazz.htm"><img border="0" src="articles_images/rmt-box.jpg" align="left" width="57" height="100"></a></font>Razz M' Tazz's Salsa/Mambo Ladies' Styling
          Workshop (approximately 55 min.):</font></b><font face="Verdana"> Led
          by Razz M' Tazz director Addie Rodriguez, the video begins with a
          series of isolating exercises, then moves on to cover basic steps and
          turns, plus some more advanced shines. The camera alternates between
          shots of Rodriguez alone demonstrating the step with styling, and
          leading a class at New York's Latin Quarter. She ends by leading a
          routine in which all the shines presented are performed to music.<br>
          </font><b><font face="Verdana">What's in it for you?</font></b><font face="Verdana">
          The isolating exercises, which begin with the head and move down to
          the hips, are great  they're even relaxing and fun, thanks to
          Rodriguez's funny, casual teaching style! And since she is instructing
          a real class in these steps at the same time, the corrections she
          makes to their mistakes are probably ones the viewer needs to hear at
          that moment, too. The shines and accompanying styling moves are
          repeated slowly, several times, so there's no feeling of being rushed.
          What I especially enjoyed were the arm movements Rodriguez uses to
          spice up basic turns. As for the advanced shines, they are called
          &quot;Addie's Sexy Steps,&quot; and believe me, they are aptly named!
          Shrinking violets, beware! A lack in this video, in my opinion, was
          that shines were not practiced to music before moving onto the next.
          Again, no matter how you've memorized the footwork and arm styling,
          you don't really know the move till you've done it to music 
          preferably with the example of an instructor who knows how in front of
          you. While the video does feature a practice of all the material
          covered set to music, it occurs at the end, maybe 20 minutes after you
          initially learned the shine, and with them all strung together, one
          right after the other. Another thing that puzzled me about this video
          was that the camera frequently spent valuable time focused on the
          students' faces as they practiced, rather than their bodies.<br>

          For those who need help loosening up, and/or want to add high drama to
          their dancing, Razz M' Tazz's video delivers.</font></p>
