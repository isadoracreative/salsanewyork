      Note:</b> </font>Shelly Green is one example of the many people who email <a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com">SalsaNewYork</a>
      when it comes to getting <a href="../instructors/home.htm">instructor</a>
      recommendation. I know from prior experience that different people have
      different needs when it comes to learning how to dance. That's why
      whenever I get an email from someone wanting a recommendation for an
      instructor I email them back a little questionnaire (for example what
      borough would you like to take classes in? What level of dancing are you
      at? Would you like a male or female instructor? Are you interested in
      weekday or weekend classes? Etc.). I use the questionnaire to help me zero
      in on the instructors who best fit that person's needs. Here Shelly gives
      us her take on the process she went through when she first decided to take
      dance classes. - Manny&nbsp;</font></p>

      have always been interested in learning to Salsa and while surfing the
      net, I found <a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com">SalsaNewYork.com</a>.&nbsp;
      Most websites have an email address in which you can submit questions,
      comments, or concerns so I did but did not expect to get a response.&nbsp;
      If I did get a response, I knew I would get it within a two to three week
      period.&nbsp; You can imagine my surprise when I received a response from <a href="http://www.mannysiverio.com">Manny</a>
      on the same day <em>and </em>he answered my questions...............he
      even had a few for me.&nbsp; <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">I
      had an interest in learning but didn't realize I had some decisions to
      make. Salsa or Mambo?&nbsp; Did I want to male instructor or a female
      instructor?&nbsp; I could not understand why the sex of the instructor was
      relevant but I received my explanation.&nbsp; Learning from an
      accomplished female instructor would help me when it came time to develop
      my &quot;style&quot; as I progressed through my classes.&nbsp; Now I had a
      better understanding I needed recommendations for instructors.&nbsp; Again
      I was asked two more question..........Did I want a weeknight class?&nbsp;
      What borough would I want to take the class?<o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><a href="http://www.addie-tude.com">Addie
      Diaz</a> was recommended among other female instructors but I chose her
      class due the information on her site and her fast response to my message.&nbsp;
      I stressed to Addie that I literally had &quot;two left feet&quot; and did
      not have a partner with whom to attend the classes.&nbsp; She told me the
      same thing Manny did that I didn't need a partner.&nbsp; She was
      reassuring and several days later, I was in <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/classinfo.htm">her
      next class</a>.<o:p>

      attended my <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/articles_teaching_style.htm">first
      class and was amazed at the set-up</a>.&nbsp; The class was divided into
      three groups of </span></font><img border="0" src="articles_images/zurich_addieteach4.JPG" align="left" width="207" height="156"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">beginners.....beginners;
      intermediate; and advanced.&nbsp; The first hour was spent learning and
      reviewing</span></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">
      basic</span></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">
      steps and the second hour was spent </span></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">practicing
      these steps with a partner.&nbsp; Addie normally has one or two persons
      assisting her so I felt as if I had the best of both worlds.&nbsp; I had
      an opportunity to dance with other students as you would in a group lesson
      but I felt that each group receives individual attention so it is almost
      as if I had a private lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget I have &quot;two
      left feet&quot;&nbsp; and it doesn't help that I am also shy.&nbsp; Well, <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/resume.htm">Addie</a>
      and her co-instructors encourage each student to keep trying and they also
      work with you till you &quot;get&quot; the move correctly.&nbsp; Your
      fellow classmates are equally supportive and offer assistance when needed.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">After
      my first class I was inspired to learn more and I kept returning.&nbsp;
      Each week the class is a little different because you constantly have new
      students joining the group and you work at your own pace.&nbsp; Isn't that
      great?&nbsp; No pressure!&nbsp; The environment is challenging yet
      nurturing and my dancing is improving also.&nbsp; Yes, I am still learning
      to &quot;Break on 2&quot; and lovin' every minute of it!<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">If
      you are a beginner such as myself or have had a desire to take a lesson, I
      suggest you take a lesson at least once.&nbsp; The class is designed for
      people like me:&nbsp; <o:p>
