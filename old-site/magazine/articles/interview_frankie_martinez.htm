        <b>FM:</b> <b>I have been dancing Mambo since 1996 and curiosity got me
        into it when I visited a nightclub in Florida with my father for the

        <b>FM: </b></font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I learned Mambo at
        the Dance Club International on Metropolitan Avenue in Queens, a

        didnt offer much when it came to Mambo and so I started to visit
        nightclubs in the City and picked up quickly by looking at the dancers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I would then sort of improvised my own moves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I later started visiting schools in the City and decided to start
        lessons with Eddie Torres.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
        Mentors have been many, including Eddie Torres; I cant deny anyone I

        </span>I never realized that this would one day lead me to choreography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It is hard work because you have to work with a group and make

        telling you that many years ago I found many albums in my mothers

        notes on them).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I
        started choreographing I went into that closet and pulled out the albums
        and spent hours just staring at them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I immediately ran to the record shop and purchased CDs of all the
        albums (Willie Colon, Ray Barreto, Ismael Miranda and ..). I have
        realized that I prefer old Mambo, Cha Cha Cha and Salsa for my
        choreography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can hear
        the beating of congas and drums clearer and the words more pronounced.
        Today some music has drowned out the words and it becomes too
        repetitious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I find that I
        like to choreograph to a story, a clear thought  a beginning and an
        end.<span style="mso-spacerun:
