    the NY dance scene for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; I use to see him at the Copa when
    I first started dancing myself.&nbsp; A true gentleman dancer, I can think of few other
    people qualified to write about the topic of Partnering and Dance Floor Etiquette. &nbsp;
    He was kind enough to allow us to re-publish this 2nd article on the SalsaNewYork

      dance? Salsa? Tango? Swing? How about Cuban style? Do you want to dance on &quot;1&quot;
      or on &quot;2,&quot; on the weekend, weekday, uptown, downtown, Jersey? Pick a place, pick
      a dance, even pick a style. If they&#146;re not already available near you, you can bet
      some of these dances are coming your way soon!</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here in New York, around much of the country
      and around much of the world, more and more people are getting involved in some form of
      partner dancing. <a href="../../calendar.htm">Clubs</a> are picking up on it, <a
      href="../instructors/home.htm">new dance studios</a> open every few months, and new dance
      functions, weekends, and workshops are being promoted ad nauseam wherever dancers
      congregate. There are even competing websites promoting their particular take on a dance.
      If you've been out to Lincoln Center's annual Midsummer's Night Swing Series, you saw ever
      larger crowds throng into the limited dance space available - space that's been increased
      every year for the last several years, but that still can't accommodate all the people
      showing up. Friday night &#150; salsa &#150; SOLD OUT. Saturday night - swing &#150;
      fuhgedaboudit! It's really an amazing phenomenon.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only has interest in general partner
      dancing grown exponentially, but interest in specific dances has mushroomed. There are
      crowded venues for dance styles as diverse as Country Western, Hustle, Lindy Hop, and West
      Coast Swing. Even Tango salons have begun to breathe life again. Functions at the US
      Amateur Ballroom Dance Association that normally attract a small following of overly
      serious, fastidiously correct dancers, have begun drawing crowds of the rhythmically
      challenged.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Latin dancing, while always popular, has
      lately developed an intense almost fanatical following. Celebrated teachers like <a
      href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> and <a
      href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy Anton</a> have virtually become venerated
      figures, while new <a href="../instructors/home.htm">dance teachers</a> hang out their
      shingles weekly. <a href="../../calendar.htm">The Latin dance circuit has expanded from a
      few big clubs like the Copacabana and Latin Quarter to include smaller venues like
      Nell&#146;s, Hush, La Belle Epoque, Bistro Latino, and dozens of others.</a> Crowds of
      dancers make a weekly pilgrimage to a variety of Latin dance functions. Some diehards even
      leave <a href="jimmy_anton_social.htm">Jimmy&#146;s bash</a> after four hours of dancing
      salsa on a Sunday evening only to head uptown to La Maganette for a couple of turns of
      charanga - this, after some of them closed the Copa the evening before!</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Obsession is not limited to the Latin scene.
      It's mirrored in the Swing crowd by people who left a recent American Swing Dance
      Championship in New Jersey after three days and nights of swing dancing only to surface
      later that evening at the Continental Club in Manhattan for, yup, some more swing dancing.</font>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Enthusiasts of Lindy Hop, a particularly
      vigorous form of swing dancing, worship shamelessly at the dancing feet of octogenarian
      icon Frankie Manning and perform a weekly ritual Shim-Sham dance at the Continental. Add
      to that the surging monthly attendance of Jehovah's Witnesses who've been descending on
      the Continental en masse the first Sunday of every month and we may be witnessing the
      start of a new religious sect centered on dance.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, these examples represent extreme
      behavior on the part of some dance enthusiasts, but there's no question that partner
      dancing is enjoying greater popularity with a far more diversified crowd than it ever has.</font>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One can't help but wonder at the underlying
      dynamics. These people embrace an assortment of races, religions, ethnic and cultural
      backgrounds - different natures AND different nurtures. They span a variety of age groups,
      educational levels, and professions. Yet, in growing numbers, they are all drawn to
      dancing like moths to a flame.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Certainly one of the more obvious reasons
      for dancing's popularity is that it's a relatively convenient form of intimate social
      interaction, call it a form of absolutely safe sex - without any physical or emotional
      risk. Within a dance, there can be communication, romance, and relationship, albeit in
      5-10 minute intervals, all limited to the dance floor. There are social opportunities for
      those who want to pursue them. There is safety in numbers for those who don't. While this
      has probably always been true for dancing, it has become an especially compelling reason
      in this day of widespread sexually transmitted diseases and fear of AIDS.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other reasons for partner dancing's
      resurgence may include some more complex socioeconomic considerations and reflect
      society's growing feelings of isolation, expendability, predictability, and
      disenfranchisement.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The past two decades have wrought major
      changes in our social fabric. As we've experienced the results of mergers, downsizing, and
      corporate re-engineering, we've found life more hostile and far less secure. Moreover, the
      workplace has shifted almost entirely to a service economy with fewer opportunities for
      individual expression and creativity. In the meantime, powerful computer and
      telecommunications technology have appeared at the desktop, and now even in the shirt
      pocket, enabling people to be highly productive autonomously. Wireless communications and
      the internet have left many business, clerical, and administrative people working alone,
      either in an office cubicle, at home, or on the road. In any case, e-mail and workgroup
      software have eliminated a considerable amount of routine face-to-face interaction.</font>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some people have adapted to the hot new
      telecommunication revolution and carved niches for themselves in cyberspace, chatting in
      &quot;chat rooms,&quot; or staking out their place on the Web. But hours spent in front of
      a computer screen only make human interaction even more compelling. So, even as technology
      has served to make people more independent, it has also made them more acutely aware of
      their isolation. Ironically, as we strive toward greater interactivity between &quot;man
      and machine,&quot; we're losing considerable interactivity between &quot;man and
      man.&quot;</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going dancing not only seeks to alleviate
      these problems, it produces a sense of excitement and vitality, a joie de vivre that also
      validates feelings of desirability and self-worth. The universal need to interact with
      people is probably what's spawning the current lively social scene at a spate of new
      bookstores cum cafes, hi-end coffee bars, and until recently, cigar bars.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Speaking of fantasy, dancing creates a
      wonderful milieu of escapist fantasy - you get to be whoever you want to be, if only for a
      short time. More importantly, during that time, you don't have to deal with the reality,
      issues, and stress you normally do. So, whether you're a bored secretary, stressed
      currency trader, doctor, lawyer, or Indian chief, you can step out onto a dance floor and
      be a dashing lothario, or an exotic femme fatale, or, Fred and Ginger &#150; hey, whatever
      turns you on!</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">An interesting byproduct of this is that
      partner dancing appears to be a genuine meritocracy. The only important criteria of a
      dancer are his/her dance ability and enthusiasm. It's not about race, religion, culture,
      profession, social standing, or even sexual persuasion. The better you are and the more
      fun you are to dance with, the more sought after you will be. Just walk into any club, the
      Copa, the Continental, or a ballroom dance studio - and see who you'd want to dance with.
      Yes, being attractive doesn't hurt, but it&#146;s quickly discounted after a dance or two.</font>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not surprisingly, men and women initially
      come to partner dancing with differing agendas. Women often begin dancing because it's a
      skill they've been meaning to acquire. Men usually come because there are women there
      (really!). After making some headway and gaining some dance skills, however, both find far
      more benefits than they anticipated.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is the sheer thrill of movement -
      being able to hear music and move rhythmically to it. Frequently, there is the discovery
      and appreciation of different types of music. Music that was heard before and ignored, now
      seems appealing, even exciting. Not to mention, there is the benefit of exercise, made
      especially valuable by being able to obtain it incidentally and without sweating. Well,
      maybe without too much sweating.</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, there is always a sense of
      gratification that comes with the realization that, YES, you are dancing. No longer
      condemned to the sidelines, looking with envy at all the people who seemingly know what
      they're doing, you are now one of them. You're a DANCER!</font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just one thing, guys - please. After you've
      had a few lessons, DON'T rush out and load up on several pairs of those black and white
      patent leather saddle shoes. You have to earn them first!</font> </p>
