&nbsp; Founder and Co-Host of SalsaNewYork.com&nbsp; -&nbsp; On 2 Mambo Nut&nbsp; - &nbsp;Social Dancer&nbsp; 
-&nbsp; Salsa DJ</font></p>

<hr color="#0000FF" size="3">

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">There we all were in <a
href="../magazine/instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a>' classes, learning New
York mambo On 2 from the <a href="http://www.digido.com/mkweb/eddietorres.html">Mambo King</a>.&nbsp;
But when it came time to take it outside of the studio and into the clubs and socials, no
one knew where to go dancing.&nbsp; And no one knew where all the other On 2 dancers from
elsewhere were going either, the club dancers or the students learning mambo from other
instructors.&nbsp; The students from each studio or clique would just party with their own
little group.&nbsp; So when we did go out, there were only a few other On 2 salseros there
to dance with.&nbsp; I decided there needed to be some way for all the On 2 dancers to
know where the good salsa events were, so that enough of them would go and we'd all have
plenty of partners to dance with.&nbsp; After all, we loved this way of dancing so much,
and we spent so much time and money learning and practicing it, what could be better than
having lots of partners to share it with?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">I started out xeroxing information on where to
go salsa dancing &quot;On 2&quot;, and handing it out to dancers in classes and
clubs.&nbsp; But whenever I heard about new events, I would have to revise the
information, re-xerox it , and pass it out all over again.&nbsp; It was pretty clumsy and
very labor-intensive.&nbsp; But dancers seemed to appreciate the info, and more of them
began showing up at events.&nbsp; I decided a web site with a calendar that I could update
frequently was the perfect solution to providing everyone with up-to-date information on
an ever-changing salsa-mambo dance scene;&nbsp; I would keep the calendar current, and the
dancers would each go to the web site for information on their own.&nbsp; And that's how
this web site came to be.&nbsp; It's main purpose was to answer the earth-shaking and
timeless question:&nbsp; &quot;where can I go dancing mambo, and where will some of the
other On 2 dancers be, so I'll have plenty of partners?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I get my reward
when I'm in a room full of On 2 salseros having a ball, and I know they found out about
that event because it was listed on this web site.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">From the very beginning, there have always
been a few negative people who have misunderstood and criticized the idea of a web site
which focuses on just one way of dancing to salsa.&nbsp; They have stated that it was in
some way exclusionary, arrogant, or suggesting that other ways of dancing to salsa were
less legitimate or less enjoyable.&nbsp; This is totally not true.&nbsp; And I have never
understood their criticism.&nbsp; Why is it OK to have a &quot;NY Yankee fan club&quot;
which does not include Mets fans, or a &quot;Ford Mustang fan club&quot; which does not
include Chevy owners, or a &quot;<a
href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/thehotjenniferlopez">Jennifer Lopez fan club</a>&quot;
that doesn't deal with Puffy (anymore), or a <a
href="http://home-3.worldonline.nl/~pjetax/">merengue web site</a> which doesn't cover
salsa, or a <a href="http://www.salsasf.com/">salsa web site</a> which doesn't include
bachata and bomba-plena, but it's not OK to have an On 2 web site which doesn't cover
other ways of dancing salsa?&nbsp; This On 2 web site offers people with a similar
interest and passion the opportunity to share it with others, and to expand and deepen
their involvement in this dance, and to widen their circle of friends....even
internationally.&nbsp; That sounds pretty good to me!&nbsp; I am very gratified to see the
numbers of people who enjoy dancing On 2 growing every year, and I consider expanding that
growth to be one of the goals of this web site.&nbsp; We openly promote dancing 
On 2.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">As time went along, and since I'm an
information freak, I have continually added more and more stuff about being a salsa dancer
here in New York, including info on dance shoes, Latin music, Latin radio programs, how to
find salsa anywhere in the world, links to other salsa web sites, how to learn to dance
mambo On 2, salsa costumes and accessories, a listing of almost every Latin club I can
discover in the New York metropolitan area, and tons more.&nbsp; It's all listed in the <a
href="../default.htm">Menus</a> on the home page.&nbsp; I invite you to take some time to
explore the whole web site and become familiar with its layout,
so it will be quick &amp; easy to locate information you want in the future.&nbsp; If you
have some particular salsa subject in mind, look for it in the <a
href="../default.htm#Index">Alphabetical Index</a> .&nbsp; And see our <a
href="../default.htm#WELCOME">Site Description</a> for more on the goals, objectives and
editorial policies of <a href="http://www.SalsaNewYork.com">www.SalsaNewYork.com</a> .</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">During this whole process of deciding to have
a web site, then learning how to create the site and fill it with information, and to
continue to maintain it, many of my friends have been very encouraging.&nbsp; I especially
want to thank Lamberto Dominici, Earl Forte, Al Pomerantz and <a
href="../magazine/home.htm">Manny Siverio</a> for their support, ideas, discussions,
feedback, and pushing me to give this project a try.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manny, who was formerly
the pioneering host of SalsaWeb.com/NY, the first serious New York mambo dancer's web site
during the time of his editorship, very graciously&nbsp; put &nbsp;an announcement on his
Home Page at that time linking viewers to this web site for direct access to events
information.&nbsp; He and I both have always shared the same desire to bring the rich
world of salsa to as many mambo dancers as possible.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Since that time, I've had the honor of Manny's
joining me here at <a href="http://www.SalsaNewYork.com">www.SalsaNewYork.com</a> as co-host, where he now provides a wealth of his very
special information in our web site's <a href="../magazine/home.htm">Dancer's Magazine</a>
: &nbsp;salsa news, celebrity interviews, directory of NY/NJ mambo instructors, articles
and features, resources for New Yorkers and visitors to the City, and much more. &nbsp;
Though we share a common philosophy and dedication to the On 2 mambo dance community, we
each handle our sections of this web site independently, and are personally responsible
for only our own section's content.&nbsp; Manny is an experienced dancer, instructor and
international performer, and has been with the <a href="../moreinfo.htm#Eddie_Torres">Eddie
Torres Dancers</a>, <a href="../moreinfo.htm#Jimmy_Anton_Dancers">Jimmy Anton Dancers</a>,
and the <a href="../moreinfo.htm#Addie-Tude">Addie-Tude Dance Company</a> , so he brings
to this web site a broad mambo perspective, a lengthy history, experience hosting a
dancer's web site, and a dedication to our New York way of dancing On 2. &nbsp; For your
convenience, Manny and I have provided many links between our two sections, his <a
href="../magazine/home.htm">Dancer's Magazine</a> and my <a
href="../default.htm#Dancer&apos;s_Guide">Dancer's Guide</a>, so that you can navigate easily
and get as much information as possible on your visit to our web site.&nbsp; And our <a
href="../default.htm">Main Menus &amp; Alphabetical Index</a> on the home page list
everything that's available on this entire web site.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Also, and very importantly, I want to thank <a
href="../magazine/instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a>, one of the true pioneers
of <a href="../ourdancemusic.htm#DEFINITION">&quot;On 2&quot; salsa dancing</a> here in
New York City. &nbsp; This &quot;On 2 dancers' web site&quot; grows out of&nbsp; the many
hours I spent in Eddie's classes over a two year period, and has been inspired by his
undying enthusiasm and commitment to teaching this one particular method of dancing mambo
to thousands of club dancers and performers over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp; His influence on
the New York mambo scene was already tremendous, and now includes the creation of
<a href="http://www.SalsaNewYork.com">www.SalsaNewYork.com</a> <strong>,</strong> a &quot;pure On 2 dancers' web
site&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Among salsa-mambo dancers, I have discovered
that about 25% don't have access to the internet.&nbsp; This is a big flaw in the salsa
web site grand master plan.&nbsp; We need your help.&nbsp; If you have dancer friends who
do not have internet access, encourage them to try it.&nbsp; Tell them there's finally a
good reason to buy that computer and get online, that salsa and computers really do
mix.&nbsp; There's such a rich world of salsa for dancers to enjoy, and so much
information about it is right here.&nbsp; So, bug your friends to hurry up and get online
before they miss another great salsa event.&nbsp; And in the meantime, keep them posted on
where to go dancing, and even print out some of this information for them. &nbsp; Thanks.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">As the old saying goes:&nbsp; &quot;There are
two kinds of people in this world&quot;.&nbsp; In the case of salsa, there are the natural
dancers, and the ones who have to learn it by being taught.&nbsp; I am this second kind of
dancer.&nbsp; And like a lot of others like me, we learn mambo slowly, sometimes really
slowly, step-by-step, breaking it down into its parts, drilling steps and shines and turn
patterns for hours, learning to hear and feel the clave, the &quot;2&quot;, the rhythm, el
sabor de la salsa.&nbsp; It takes months and years. &nbsp; And our results are directly
related to how hard we work at it: how often we go to classes, drill, practice, and go out
dancing socially.&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the way, some people say to you:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You
practice salsa all those hours, every week? &nbsp; Are you crazy?&nbsp; For God's sake,
Get a Life!&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Down the road, they still can't do their
&quot;basic step&quot;, or keep the count all the way through a song, especially a slow song,
or do a double right turn.&nbsp; Or they've stopped dancing salsa altogether.&nbsp; On the
other hand, more and more, <strong>we</strong> have those times when it all comes
together:&nbsp; the music, our dancing, the feeling of that addictive salsa rhythm, that
excitement with our partners, the friendships with other dancers from all walks of life,
the thrill and fascination of being in a club or studio and being surrounded by great
salseros...and <strong>we're</strong> dancing with them.&nbsp; Looking pretty good,
too.&nbsp; We've definitely &quot;Got A Life!&quot; &nbsp; Whether salsa is our whole
life, or an exciting part of our life, there is so much more to our lives because of the
richness of this music and dance.&nbsp; !WEPA! &nbsp; This web site is our contribution to
that richness.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="There">There</a> are a lot of awesome
salseros out there. &nbsp; But only a few of them have the talent to teach us how to
dance.&nbsp; We often don't appreciate our teachers enough. &nbsp; Several people have
helped me tremendously to learn the technique, pleasure and excitement of dancing
the &quot;Eddie Torres New York style&quot; mambo On 2, some as teachers and others as practice partners.&nbsp; With their knowledge and skill of salsa, their inspired teaching or sharing
the secrets of mambo, their enthusiasm and passion for the dance, their support and
encouragement of my efforts, their amazing patience for my slow pace of improvement, their
confronting and pushing me on what I needed to work on, they have helped me get to this
point in my dancing. &nbsp; I want to say a special thanks to
