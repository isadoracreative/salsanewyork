      <p ALIGN="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ive
      never really given much thought how beneficial it would be to have as many
      dancers in one room as I did in Switzerlands first congress ever.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was an
      anticipation of how well Switzerlands first attempt at a congress would
      be received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>Would the public like it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>Would the dancers enjoy themselves?<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It
      didnt take long for those questions to be answered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>As a dancer and performer all my expectations were exceeded.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Our
      first of three performances in Switzerland was approximately 12 hours
      after I arrived with the dance company I dance with: <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/danceco.htm">The
      Addie-tude Dance Company</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The first place we performed at was a club called Extra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>Extra was the site of the pre-congress party and it was very
      specious with a stage and the floor very comfortable to dance on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>A few minutes before we came on stage to perform I decide to peek
      out at the crowd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>All I saw was a sea of heads with no end in sight except for the
      back wall of the club, which was a bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>I definitely thought to myself Damn this place is packed.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
      next following night the congress officially started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The location  the old Congress House of the Swiss Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>A beautiful venue, very spacious and lots of room for dancers and
      spectators alike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>At the back of the stage was a big screen that presented the
      dancers up close for those who couldnt get close to the stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The Swiss definitely had comfort and availability in mind when they
      thought this out.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We
      chose our <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/photos_latin_madness_hustler.htm">Hustler</a>
      number for our second night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The girls in our group were awesome and <a href="http://www.mannysiverio.com">Manny
      Siverio</a> and I definitely worked out any kinks in the number before we
      got on stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The number is a bit violent since it is based on two rival gangs
      facing off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>It is for sure a number that the world salsa community has rarely
      seen and it was well received.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">On
      our third night at the congress our newest number <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/photos_muneca_Zurich2002.htm">(Muneca)</a>
      was chosen to close out the show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>Our newest number had only been performed in public twice before in
      the United States to good reviews and we were very anxious to see how the
      congress would respond to our baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The congress house was packed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>My adrenaline really started to pump after that sight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>This crowd really wanted a show, and we were aching to give it to
      them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>We
      rehearsed these numbers 3, 4, sometimes 5 times a week, late into the
      night, to get it just right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>It was what we prepared for, what we sacrificed for, what we came
      to Switzerland for.</span></font></p>

      moment our dance shoes hit the stage we were in perfect sync with each
      other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>The
      chemistry was great and I felt as if at any point in time on stage I knew
      exactly what all the dancers on stage were doing at any time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>It was a weird feeling of connection without having to touch or see
      your partner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>We were a hit and it is one of my favorite times on stage.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Myself
      personally, when Im on stage the music sounds so far away and all I
      really can hear or feel is my heartbeat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>I dont know if its stage fright but I know that when its
      over I cant wait for it to happen again.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are times in a
      performance when sometimes things dont go as planned, or as perfect as
      one would have liked and it happens to the best of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>But what I enjoyed most was the camaraderie of my fellow dancers at
      the Congress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>There is always a little clique going on here and there in every
      congress but in Switzerland you didnt mind those things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The cliques were there but they lost in every way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>The congress in more than an exhibition of the best dancers and
      dance teams from all over the world, Its also a chance to exchange
      ideas, tips, information, steal moves, whatever. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span>As
      dancers we have to grow and I definitely felt a growth spurt those 4 or 5
      days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span></font></span><img border="0" src="articles_images/zurich_lou_bret_artists.JPG" align="right" width="288" height="216"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:

      Rico</a>, Leon Rose, Salsa Brava, Pedro Gomez. Edie Lewis, Miriam Ponce De
      Leon, Juan Carlos, etc, etc, were a joy to be with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
      </span>We partied, exchanged ideas and gossip late into the night and into
      the morning and I felt changed by the experience in a good way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
