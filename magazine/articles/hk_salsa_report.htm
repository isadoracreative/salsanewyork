<font size="2">Winsome Lee performing with Jimmy Anton in<br>
Hong Kong this past August 1999</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Thanks to modern day technologies, global communication is
remarkable nowadays. It has definitely made the world a smaller place and
information can now flow smooth and fast. With the help of the Internet and more
realistic traveling opportunities, Salsa has spread to South America, Europe,
and the Far East from the Caribbean and New Yorks Spanish Harlem. Five years
ago, who would have thought that I could one day come back to my native city to
perform and teach Salsa?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Over the last couple of years Salsa has boomed in Hong Kong.
Several Cuban bands such as Cubanismo have visited this glamorous city saturated
with cellular phones and Mercedes Benz. In August I was invited to come and
perform in various events and to conduct Salsa workshops. The biggest event was <strong>&quot;Salsa
Night&quot; </strong>which took place at the beautiful <strong>HITEC Grand
Rotunda,</strong> the first column-free ballroom style rotunda hall in Hong
Kong. The lighting and sound systems were superb. More than 400 local Salsa
lovers attended the event which took place from 3PM until midnight. The sponsors
and organizers treated us royally and professionally. My partner for this trip
was Maestro <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm"><strong>Jimmy Anton</strong></a>
and together we conducted 4 <i>&quot;New York Style Salsa&quot;</i> workshops 6
hours straight before our dance performances. Many of the attendees had enough
stamina to attend all 4 workshops, with an average of 135 people each. To my
pleasant surprise, they were very interested in our &quot;shines&quot; and kept
asking for more. At the end of the evening, <strong>Jimmy and I performed two
routines - Tito Puentes <i>Picadillo</i> and <i>Fiesta a la King</i>.</strong>
The one thing that Jimmy and I are not used to was a relatively tame audience
Especially coming straight from the <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/danceco_manny_s_mam_fu.htm"><strong><i>Bacardí
Congreso de la Salsa</i> in Puerto Rico</strong></a> where the crowds screamed
so loud you could hardly hear the music, this felt somewhat foreign to us. For
Asians, Salsa is still a shock to their system. Most Asians are not raised to
flaunt their bodies, or to express their feelings as openly as Westerners and
Latinos. Hugging their parents is not done often, let alone watching them kiss
each other on their anniversary. Even though the love of Salsa is established
here, the people are not yet expressing their excitement as wildly as the
average Latino audience. It took us a few gigs to get used to their &quot;calm,
cool, and collected applause&quot;. This does not mean, however, a lack of
enthusiasm by any means. After our 2 routines the audience were yelling &quot;Otra,
otra, otra...&quot; and we did an encore number to <strong>El Canarios <i>&quot;La
Paella</i>&quot;.</strong> Some were even asking for our autographs on our
posters and flyers, and many expressed interest to continue learning our style.
My phone was ringing off the hook with keen Salsa lovers.</font></p>

&quot;In August I was invited to come and perform in various events and to
conduct Salsa<br>
workshops.....The biggest event was <strong>&quot;Salsa Night&quot;</strong>.......My
partner for this trip was<br>
Maestro <strong><a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy Anton</a>.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">After the events, I have decided to stay for a few months to
carry on teaching &quot;New York Style Salsa&quot; here. I have since learned
that many New York dance instructors have been to various foreign countries to
teach workshops, yet in such a limited time frame the people couldnt absorb
fully the information. When I went to Argentina last year for the same purpose
and recently to Japan to attend some Salsa events, the biggest comment I have
heard is that once these overseas instructors leave after 5 days of workshops,
most students tend to forget and fall back to their same old routine. Therefore
I hope that with my slightly prolonged stay in Hong Kong, I could assist them
digest the information we brought. After all, I am one of them and I want the
Salseros here to be able identify with me.</font></p>

workshop Students.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Since Salsa is still at the early stage here, people are very
hungry for information. The passion is solid, and more and more venues are
catering to Salsa events almost every night of the week. There are Hong Kong
born instructors as well as instructors who have moved here from overseas. They
each have their own styles and are active in organizing Salsa events such as the
Salsa Cruise, Rueda workshops, beach parties etc. Female instructors are scarce
and the ladies are yearning for more examples to look up to. In mingling with
the local Salseros I have noticed that many have learnt from L.A. instructional
videos. <strong>The name <a href="http://www.salsaweb.com/salsabrava">Salsa
Brava</a> seems to be a household name, yet our famous Mambo King <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie
Torres</a> remains unknown to most. </strong>Aside from familiarizing the people
here with more Mambo celebrities such as the Godfather himself, other things
Im working on are encouraging more direct responses from the crowd. One thing
I have already succeeded in is enforcing the first &quot;birthday dance
ritual&quot; - posses from England, France, Africa, Australia and Belgium
saluted an entranced Japanese Salsera on her birthday.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The most unique thing about the Salsa scene in Hong Kong is
that being an international city, there is a wide range of styles. <strong>My
classes comprise of British, French, Swiss, Australians, Mexicans, Germans,
Filipinos, Shanghainese, and Hongkongese. </strong>Some have studied in their
own respective countries and brought with them their own unique interpretation
of dancing Salsa. Most of them have never heard of &quot;dancing on 2&quot; and
are semi-fascinated, but also semi-wary of picking up something more
&quot;complicated&quot;. However, there are also a good number of &quot;die
hards&quot; who are determined to meet this new challenge and they come to my
classes religiously. Next to the partnering classes, the &quot;Mambo
Shines&quot; classes are very well-received. Many think its a great
alternative to working out at the gym and also love the way the footwork look. I
have once gone into a club and found some ladies scratching their heads trying
to remember a <i>shine</i> from the class, and when they saw me they grabbed me
with such relief and excitement to remind them. Naturally there are discussions
about dancing on the &quot;2&quot; versus the &quot;1&quot; - which one is more
popular, authentic etc. My answer to them is that it is all about the dancing,
one is not &quot;better&quot; than the other. Its just that coming from New
York, my strength is at the &quot;2&quot; school. Plus after this years Salsa
Congress I have noticed that more countries are adopting this style. I want to
be able to give my own people the choice - at least they now know that there is
such a sensational thing as &quot;dancing on 2&quot;, and that if they want to
learn it there is a source. Thanks to the genuine support of the local
instructors and my sponsor, I am finally able to do so.</font></p>

<strong>Winsome</strong> Leading one her popular Mambo<br>
classes/workshops in Hong Kong.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Back home in New York, my biggest excitement in a Salsa club
was to dance up a storm with my favorite dancers. Not that I love that feeling
any less, but I have now found a greater joy when I watch the students here
begin to dance what I have taught. It has certainly been challenging both for me
and for them, and at the beginning everyone was hesitant to try it outside of
the classroom. However, the progress is happening gradually and surely. First
there was only one couple struggling to dance a Mambo, then there were two
couples making an attempt. In a Salsa club last night, four couples were having
a blast dancing Mambo at one point. When I left I was beaming all the way home
in the cab.</font></p>

Compiled by Manny Siverio<br>
<strong>Winsome</strong> has made an impact in the <strong>HK Salsa Scene</strong>
by bringing in the <strong>NY style</strong> of dancing Salsa/Mambo. She arrived
in HK in peace. She has shown that she was not there to start a timing war, but
to share and exchange with other Salsa lovers. I'm sure that she has learn just
as much about HK dancing as she has been able to show them about NY Style
dancing. Here she and Jimmy are being interviewed on a local HK radio show.<br>

<br>
Winsome Lee and Jimmy Anton put on some excellent performances whilst here<br>
in Hong Kong. We have the pleasure of having Winsome here to teach some<br>
mambo classes for a short period of time. The first set of workshops, which<br>
we both attended were fun-filled, challenging and had some eye-catching<br>
sequences and steps thrown in..and that was just the beginners class. What<br>
Winsome does is to lure you into a false sense of security by first getting<br>
you to relax in the classes. Then she starts off with some very basic steps<br>
and then gradually challenges you to do these very nice shine, hand and body<br>
moves. For those who practise these moves, the improvement can be<br>
startlingly rapid. If you can, join in these classes if only to see the<br>
alternative way of dancing salsa so you have a more varied repertoir of<br>
moves.<br>
<br>
Message 387 lists more classes which Winsome will be conducting. Hope to see<br>
you there.<br>
Regards to you all.</font></p>
