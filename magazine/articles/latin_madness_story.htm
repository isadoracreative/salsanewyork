  <b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  <p>Beginnings:<br>
  </font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Its no secret that every professional
  dancer in the NY Mambo community at one time or another has wanted to dance on
  Broadway, especially after seeing such plays like SWING, RIVERDANCE and
  FOREVER TANGO. Well early in the year 2000, NY mambo instructors <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
  Flores</a> and <a href="../instructors/side_street_kids.htm">Carlos Mendoza</a>
  seriously started to entertain the idea of producing their own
  &quot;Off-Broadway Mambo Play&quot;. If no one else would do it, then they
  might as well do it themselves. The two men slowly began to talk with other
  local dancers to see if they too would be interested in being a part of this
  &quot;Mambo Experiment&quot;.</p>
  <b>
  <p>The Seeds to Latin Madness:<br>
  </b>It was at this point that their research began. During the summer of the
  year 2000, <a href="../instructors/side_street_kids.htm">Carlos Mendoza</a>
  converted his <a href="../instructors/side_street_kids.htm">SIDE STREET KIDS</a>
  student summer recital into a play and it was well received. Later on, <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
  Flores</a> traveled to London with his dance team (Descarga Latina) and The
  Santo Rico Dance Company and produced a mambo show that flowed smoothly from
  number to number. These two successes were the seeds that helped fuel the
  creation of &quot;<a href="latin_madness_home.htm">LATIN MADNESS&quot;.</a></p>
  <b>
  <p>The Concept to Latin Madness:<br>
  </b>Nelson and Carlos began finalizing work on the concept behind Latin
  Madness when Nelson returned from London. The two of them decided on making </font><b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2" COLOR="#008080">&quot;Latin
  Madness</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">&quot; into a mambo musical
  that would take audiences through the last 25 years of the ever-changing NY
  Latin dance scene covering the rhythms of disco in the '70's, the re-birth of
  mambo in the '80's and finally visit Side Street, the Bronxs haven for
  mambo dancing throughout the 90's.</p>
  <b>
  <p>Picking the Cast:<br>
  </b>Once the concept for <a href="latin_madness_home.htm">Latin Madness</a>
  was set down on paper, talent for the show needed to be chosen. This proved to
  be a double edge sword for the promoters. You see New York is filled with many
  excellent mambo dancers. But who to choose from??? Think of it, were the
  hometown to <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> the
  Mambo King and other well known dancers like <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille
  Thomas</a>, <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy Anton</a>, <a href="../instructors/david_melendez.htm">David
  Melendez</a> and <a href="../instructors/mario_diaz.htm">Mario Diaz</a>. The
  promoters finally opted to use dance companies with choreographed material
  that fit into the shows overall storyline. It was a hard decision and they
  hope that no one felt insulted, ignored or overlooked in the process. This is
  how Descarga Latina, Addie-Tude Dance Co., The Abakua Dancers, Santo Rico
  Dance Co., The Mambo Mamas and Jai &amp; Candy were chosen to be a part of the
  show.</p>
  <b>
  <p>The First Meeting:<br>
  </b>Roughly 7 weeks before the show, Nelson called a general meeting with all
  the dancers/dance companies that would make up the cast of Latin Madness. They
  met on a Sunday night over at the Boys Harbor Community Center in Spanish
  Harlem. This was where they all met, said their hellos, shook hands and got an
  idea of what Nelson and Carlos expected from them as a team. The cast was
  given rehearsal dates, ticket buying information and theater location. The
  next time they saw each other it would during rehearsals.</p>
  <b>
  <p>The Side Street Kids Academy Rehearsals:<br>
  </b>Carlos Mendoza kindly allowed the cast of Latin Madness to <a href="latin_madness_rehearsephotos.htm">rehearse
  over at the Side Street Kids Academy</a>. The cast met ever Friday and
  Saturday night in April prior to the performance. This was where the actual
  performing sequence was going to be decided. At this point enter <b>Maria
  Tirado</b>. Maria is a founding member of Descarga Latina and one of Nelson
  Flores right-hand dancers. She had sat down and visited most of the teams
  performing to study and evaluate the material they had to offer for the show.
  It was Maria (along with Nelson &amp; Carlos) who decided the sequence in
  which the material (performances) would presented. During the first weekend
  worth of rehearsals, a rough sequence for the numbers were established. This
  was where many of the <a href="latin_madness_home.htm#cast_directory">cast
  members</a> saw for the first time the new choreography by Descarga, Addie-tude
  and Abakua. The Mambo Mamas, Santo Rico and Jai &amp; Candy would join the
  cast rehearsals on the following weekend. Since each dance company was
  expected to know their own choreography, most of the remaining time was spent
  on learning new material (the floor work for the Opening NY Mambo Class Scene,
  The Big Spender number, Love For Sale drag number, The Shining Knight Cha-Cha
  number, The second Act Side Street Club Opener scene and The Soneros cast
  finale).</p>
  <b>
  <p>Working Together As A Team:<br>
  </b>I already mentioned that each dance company was expected to know their own
  material, so even though they were all working together as the cast of
  &quot;Latin Madness&quot;, many still seem to be clinging onto their group
  individuality. It was only when they began to mix dance teams together that
  the transformation from <b>&quot;US</b> to <b>&quot;WE&quot;</b> started to
  happen. For example during the<b> &quot;Big Spender&quot;</b> number there
  were members of the Mambo Mamas, Abakua and Descarga working together
  (choreographed by Maria Tirado). During the<b> &quot;Love For Sale&quot;</b>
  drag number there were members of Descarga, Abakua and Santo Rico working
  together (choreography by <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie Diaz</a>)
  and during the <b>&quot;Shining Knight&quot; </b>Cha-Cha number there were
  members of Addie-Tude, Descarga and Jai &amp; Candy working together
  (choreography by <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie Diaz</a>). But
  it was the <b>&quot;Soneros&quot;</b> grand finale that put the entire cast
  together for a true show of professionalism and comradery (choreographed by
  Wilton Beltre, staged by <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
  Flores</a> &amp; Maria Tirado). Then there was the opening Mambo Class scene
  in Act I (staged by Nelson Flores, Herbie Quinones) and the Side Street Club
  opening scene for Act II. Not only did</p>
  <b>
  <p>Tying It All Together:<br>
  </b>The trick was finding a way to tie all the dancing together. The producers
  solution: comedy. To keep the show flowing from segment to segment, Nelson and
  Carlos decided to use a comedian as the M.C. (Master of Ceremony) for the
  entire play. His job was to introduce the acts, educate the audience on the
  history behind the development of mambo in NY and of course to make them
  laugh. At this point, enter <b>Herbie Quinones</b>. Herbie was the man of the
  hour. He did an excellent job of making of introducing the numbers while
  providing a sense of continuity to audience members. He basically helped make
  the show into something more than simply dance performances. With him at the
  helm he transformed <a href="latin_madness_home.htm">Latin Madness</a> into a
  the big musical-dramatic-comedy Off-Broadway production it was billed to be.<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Theater Rehearsal:<br>
  </b>The week before the show was when the <a href="latin_madness_rehearse_theater.htm">cast
  members first step foot into the Heckscher Theater</a> (at Boys Harbor/Museo
  Del Barrio in Spanish Harlem). This was where they began to try to iron out
  any kinks in the show. Dancers worked on hitting their marks, on smoothing out
  their entrances and exists, on figuring out wardrobe changes, lighting &amp;
  curtain cues. Being there felt right to many dancers who were finally seeing
  their dream come true. Mambo was going to be showcased theatrically and they
  were going to be the first ones to do it. True that everyone from producer to
  dancer was trying to figure out how to pull this off. No one had been a part
  of a play of this magnitude before and they were winging it to some extent.
  Everyone hit obstacles, but managed to quickly find solutions and overcome
  them. It was not a high budget production (<a href="latin_madness_home.htm#cast_directory">cast
  members</a> and the producers even had to help put down their own dance floor
  on stage), but that wasnt going to stop them from giving a high budget
  performance. They did all they could with the time that the producers could
  afford to rent out the theater for. They even ran a dry rehearsal early on the
  same day of their first show. Ready or not it come; D-day for Latin Madnesss
  first show was finally here.</p>
  <b>
  <p>Show Time:<br>
  </b>The night of the first show was filled with excitement and energy.
  Something that everyone back stage would feel from opening curtain to the last
  pose. The show was going to have it all: mambo, hustle, cha-cha, merengue,
  comedy and even history. People from Washington DC, Connecticut and as far as
  London &amp; Japan had come into town to see the show. The first two
  performances had sold out within weeks and due to popular demand tickets for a
  third show had gone on sale. It was really an incredible feat when you think
  that it was done by just word of mouth and Internet promotion.</p>
  <p>A little known fact among audience members and a testament to the true
  level of talent and professionalism among cast members was that the first show
  was in reality the Latin Madness dress rehearsal. The cast never had the time
  to actually do one, so in essence the first show was it for them. Cast members
  used their prior experience as performers to figure out the most efficient way
  of getting in and out of costume. It was also during show time that the cast
  began to feel &amp; act as one team. People were helping each other out,
  wishing each other good luck, cheering each other on before going on stage and
  congratulating them as they got off stage. It was a wonderful feeling that had
  spread among the performers and the audience loved it. Everyone did their job;
  the dancers danced, Herbie did his comedy thing and the audience rewarded them
  with a standing ovation. Mambo had finally moved up a step and into the
  limelight and it had a name: <a href="latin_madness_home.htm">Latin Madness</a>.</p>
  <b>
  <p>Special Moments to Remember:<br>
  </b>The show had many memorable moments. Here are some that stand out:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Laying Down the Floor<br>
        </b>The first day the cast began to rehearse on stage at the theater,
        the men present from the various dance companies went straight to work
        on laying down a dance surface on the stage. The current stage surface
        was not ideal for mambo dancing purposes. No one was giving orders or
        taking charge. It was another moment of true team work. Looking back on
        that moment, it gives a whole new meaning to the term &quot;floor
        work&quot;.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-Show Group Prayer<br>
        </b>Before every show, the entire cast would gather downstairs (under
        the stage) to hold hands and pray. The first night <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie
        Diaz</a> and <a href="../instructors/thomas_guerrero.htm">Thomas
        Guerrero</a> led the pre-performance prayer session. It was a very
        inspirational moment among cast members and the beginning of the roller
        coaster rush of feelings that would stay with the performers till the
        end of the show. The first prayer session was also (in my opinion) the
        defining moment when the feeling of &quot;One Cast&quot; and &quot;One
        Dance Company&quot; was clearly felt among all the performers.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Group Hug<br>
        </b>A another great moment to remember was the very end of the first
        show after the final curtain went down. The performers were still
        hearing the audience applause as they began to cheer, shake hands, hug
        one another, give each other the high-five, yell out for joy (&quot;We
        did it&quot;) and let out some emotional tears. The cast was overjoyed
        with an emotional high as they gathered on stage, gave each other a huge
        cast group hug, bounced up and down while chanting &quot;Latin
        Madness&quot; and &quot;On2&quot;.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Cast Photo<br>
        </b>Another memorable moment was at the end of the third performance. It
        was the last show and Nelson wanted everyone to take a photo of the
        original Latin Madness cast. They were joined by Artie Ramos (Owner of
        Side Street and the man responsible for providing a dance haven to so
        many different dancers in the Bronx during the 80's &amp; 90's). All
        that could be heard was the buzz (among cast members) of when would
        there be another show. The cast was excited and never wanted it to end.
        It was a real joy and honor for many of them to be a part of such a
        historic NY Mambo event and the moment was forever frozen during the
        cast photo.</li>
      </ul>

  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>China Club &quot;Soneros&quot;<br>
        </b>During night of the last show, <a href="latin_madness_home.htm#cast_directory">the
        cast of Latin Madness</a> got together for a not-official cast After
        Party at the China Club. People were still feeling the high of the last
        three days and were happy for an excuse to get together for one more
        time. But the most interesting moment of the night was when the China
        Club DJ had accidentally put on the Soneros number that was the grand
        cast finale of the Latin Madness show. Until then people had been social
        dancing. Then a strange thing started to happen. Cast members started to
        do their part of the finale on the China Club dance floor. Before you
        knew it, cast members were scrambling to get into position to do their
        part of the number complete with entrances and exists. The next thing
        the China Club management knew was that the Latin Madness crew had taken
        over the dance floor and repeated their finale performance. The cast
        came, they saw, they danced, they conquered. Latin Madness was here to
        stay.</li>
      </ul>

  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Ticket Sales The Day After<br>
        </b>It interesting to note that the very next day after the performance,
        Nelson Flores received some 42 requests for an additional show. I think
        that this will always prove to me that there is a demand for a show like
        &quot;Latin Madness&quot;.</li>
      </ul>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Summing It Up:<br>
  </b>No story on Latin Madness could be complete without giving credit to the
  people who help make this a reality.</p>
  <blockquote>

        </b><a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson Flores</a> &amp; <a href="../instructors/side_street_kids.htm">Carlos
        Mendoza</a>, these two men did what no one else in NY had been able to
        do; which was to get various mambo dance companies together under one
        roof and get them to work together as a team. They took the mambo dancer
        and put them onto center stage, in essence making them the star of the
        play. They proved that there was a market for a mambo dancing play and
        that people would be willing to pay to see it.</li>
