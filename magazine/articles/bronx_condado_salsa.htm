        <p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#000080" size="6">Bronx
        Still the Salsa Borough<br>
        </font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"><i><b>How the northernmost
        borough got its snappy nickname<br>
        </b></i>-by anonymous author</p>
        <p align="left">El Condado de la Salsa is home to some 350,000 Puerto
        Rican and more salsa legends than any other place outside of Puerto
        Rico. The ivory-tickling Palmieri brothers grew up in the Bronx. So did
        percussionist Ray Barretto, Willie Colon, Dave Valentin, Orlando Marin
        Marin, Nicky Marrero and the Rodriguez brothers (Ray, Jimmy and Bobby).</p>
        <p align="left">But where did the northermost borough get its snappy
        nickname? Opinions on the subject abound, although everyone seems to
        agree that turn-of-the-century Bronx is still the place to go for salsa
        and Latin music in general,</p>
        <p align="left">Oscar Rivera, manager and co-owner of Tito Puentes
        (64 City Island Ave.), doesnt hesitate when asked how the Bronx got
        its nickname. &quot;Thats easy. Youve got two million Hispanics
        living in New York City, most of them Puerto Ricans living in the
        Bronx.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Although Tito Puentes is a restaurant, it is also
        known for its weekend Latin jazz shows, which attract top performers
        like Lionel Hampton, Ralph Irizarry, Orlando Marin, Chocolate, Potato
        and Dave Valentin.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Were known for the food and the music,&quot;
        says Rivera, who opened the restaurant in 1995 after approaching the
        venues namesake and getting permission to use his famous moniker.</p>
        <p align="left">Latin jazz shows at Tito Puentes are Friday and
        Saturday nights from 7:30 to 11:00 p.m. in addition to the Latin jazz
        Sunday brunch from noon to 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p align="left">Prestige Productions John &quot;Gungie&quot; Rivera,
        who also heads Prestigio Records, has been in the New York City music
        business for over 20 years as a deejay, club and concert promoter and
        record executive. Gungie attributes the Bronxs saucy salsa reputation
        to the playeros (beach parties) that use to be held at Orchard Beach.
        &quot;Those concerts sort of made a mark in the salsa industry,&quot;
        Rivera recalls. &quot;And if you remember some of the salsa clubs - Chez
        Sensual, Hippo Campo, Night Tracks,&quot; he adds, naming a few of the
        old-time salsa hot spots that have been replaced by Riveras own
        Rhumba and places like Wild Palm.</p>
        <p align="left">Gungie sees salsa music as &quot;going nowhere but
        up&quot; right now, although when he first hit the scene, Puerto Rican
        kids we &quot;always into other culture: dance techno, freestyle, rap,
        ragge.&quot; Later, he says, &quot;Salsa sor of crossed into other
        marketplaces and has touched the other demographic  younger
        audiences,&quot; having the effect, oddly enough, of making it more
        attractive to young Puerto Ricans.</p>
        <p align="left">Rhumba (396 E. Tremont Ave.) Puts on live salsa and
        merengue concerts on Saturday and Mondays, says Rivera, who has paired
        salsa legends like Pete &quot;El Conde&quot; Rodriguez with hot
        newcomers like La India in order to spark youths interest in their
        musical heritage.</p>
        <p align="left">At Rhumba, you can expect to find the musical royalty of
        the salsa world - people like George LaMond and Jose Alberto &quot;El
        Canario&quot; - as well as stars in the merengue scene like Oro Solido,
        Frase Klave and Joseph &quot;El Gato&quot; Portes. Merengue, though
        native to the Dominican Republic, is very popular with Puerto Ricans and
        , says Rivera, &quot;its a lot easier to dance to [than salsa].&quot;</p>
        <p align="center"></font><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>'Theres no
        place like the Bronx<br>
        </b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="3">for Latin music. The
        restaurants<br>
        and nightclubs keep the flavor.</font></b></p>
        <font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
        <p align="left">Another popular Latin music venue in the Bronx is Mitch
        and Mannys Wild Palm (1601 Bronxdale Ave., corner of Pierce).
        Accroding to Wild Palm manager and promoter Michael Agosto, &quot;We are
        the last true salsa nightclub in New York City.&quot; Given the fact
        that most other locales play a mix of salsa and other music  Latin
        jazz, merengue, Latin house, hip-hop  he may have a point.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;The type of music we play is nostalgic salsa 
        salsa for the dancers.&quot; Wild Palm plays &quot;a little bit of
        merengue and bachata,&quot; concedes Agosto, &quot;but our main thing is
        salsa. Thats why this club has become very popular.&quot; Mitch and
        Mannys Wild Palm presents live salsa every Friday and Saturday night.</p>
        <p align="left">Asked why the Bronx is known as El Condado de la Salsa,
        Agosto says, &quot;Well, a lot of the dancers reside in the Bronx 
        Orchard Beach, Bedford Park. A lot of the salsa concerts take place in
        the Bronx and there are a lot of popular dance schools that support
        salsa. Therefore, when people go dancing in other boroughs and see
        people dancing salsa they ask, By the way, whered did you learn to
        dance? Thats where the name comes from.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Although its only six years old, Jimmys Bronx
        Café (281 West Fordham Road, corner of the Major Deegan) is already a
        Bronx nightclub staple. Jimmys self-proclaimed &quot;VIP Guy,&quot;
        popular local comedian Casper Martinez, says that Jimmys is the place
        to go and hear live salsa on a Saturday night. On other nights, Jimmys
        deejays play a mix of salsa, merengue, house and other popular music.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Wow. You come up on Friday or Saturday night and
        see people coming from all the boroughs, all over the world to our club,
        for the music and food,&quot; says Jimmys proprietor Jimmy Rodriguez.
        &quot;The African-American community is in love with salsa and merengue
        right now. Ive been around for 15 to 18 years in the party scene, and
        Ive never seen the African-American community in love with salsa the
        way they are now. We do a little bit of everything  salsa for 20
        minutes, then merengue, then hip-hop and R&amp;B.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Its been 40 or 50 years,&quot; says Jimmy of
        the Bronxs musical legacy. &quot;Back in the days of all the social
        clubs, everywhere you went you could find salsa  all over the
        Bronx.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">But is the Bronx still a hub of Latin Nightlife?
        &quot;Well theres no place like the Bronx for Latin music. Willies
        and Jimmys and the restaurants and nightclubs  they keep the
        flavor,&quot; he says.</p>
        <p align="left">Martinez, meanwhile, has a more grassroots explanation
        for the El Condado de la Salsa label. &quot;I guess its because you
        go to parks in the Bronx and theres always a guy jamming with a
        guiro, a cowbell and a conga  doom-DOOM-DOOM-doom. Thats all it
        ever took: a guiro, a cowbell and a couple of congas and you have el
        verano en Nueva York.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Willies Steak House (1832 Westchester Ave.) Has been
        a Bronx fixture for over 20 years. Lately, its reputation for Latin Jazz
        is starting to overtake its reputation for great steaks. On Wednesday
        nights, Willies is packed to the gills with a friendly crowd of
        Latin-jazz fans from the neighborhood and around the city.</p>
        <p align="left">And, still going strong after all these years, Orchard
        Beach continues to be ideal place doe a salsa or merengue show, with the
        sun and the surf providing the tropical backdrop for the Caribbean
        sounds.</p>
        <p align="left">Local promoter Ralph Paniagua Jr. has been putting on
        salsa and merengue shows at Orchard Beach for the past five years. This
        years Tropical Music Festival at Orchard Beach, with shows every
        Sunday afternoon through Sept. 4, includes hot artists like Grupo Niche,
        Hector Tricoche, Junior Gonzalez, Pete &quot;El Conde&quot; Rodriguez,
        Cuco Valoy, Conjunto Clasico and Frase Klave.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Back in the 60's,&quot; says Paniagua, &quot;the
        Bronx was the mecca of salsa. They had clubs like the Colgate Gardens,
        Club 310½ and the Hunts Point Palace, where you could see guys like
        Harry Harlow, Tito Puente, Willie Colon, Machito and Cal Tjader from
        noon to four in the morning for like $3.</p>
        <p align="left">While it seems that everyone has a slightly different
        explanation of the origins of the Bronxs nickname, there is one thing
        that they all agree on: The scene is still alive and thriving in El
        Condado de la Salsa.</p>
