  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This Month we interview ex-NY Mambo
  INstructor <b>Oscar Soto</b>. Oscar was one of several people who taught On2
  dancing at the Sandra Cameron Dance Studio over the years. At the time he
  cooperated with me by filling out this cyber-interview with the promise that
  it would be out in a couple of issues. Like <a href="interview_nydia_ocasio.htm">Nydia
  Ocasio's interview</a> an issue ago, it got misplaced and lost in the shuffle
  of documents stored in my computer. Oscar has since then moved out to Arizona.
  Though not teaching mambo anymore, he still can be seen returning to NY to get
  his quick fix of dancing at socials like <a href="jimmy_anton_social.htm">Jimmy
  Anton's Bi-Monthly Social Dance</a>. Oscar, I'm sorry it took so long to get
  this out, your both a gentlemen and a scholar. Hope to see you soon on the
  dance floor. -Manny Siverio&nbsp;</font></p>

  </font></i></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000">SNY: How
  long have you been dancing mambo and what got you into it?<br>
  OS: </font></b>About 40 years. I grew up with this music and danced it even
  before they called it &quot;salsa&quot;. It was part of any celebration of my
  family back in Puerto Rico.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#800000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Where
  did you originally learn how to dance mambo and who was<br>
  (were) your mentors?</font></b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b><br>
  OS:</b></font> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">I learned on the street,
  by imitation. When I came to New York a lot of people considered me a very
  good dancer but it was not until I was asked to teach that I took lessons in
  order to learn to count and be able to transmit my knowledge.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#800000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">How
  long have you been teaching mambo and what made you decide to<br>
  teach mambo?</font></b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b><br>
  OS:</b></font> I've taught for 5 years </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">(editor's
  note: circa 1999)</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">. I fell into the job after I helped a
  friend get a job as teacher and when she resigned, they asked me.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#800000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font></b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>What
  do you like most about teaching?<br>
  OS:</b></font> The love and appreciation that I get from my students.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>SNY: Why do you
  think people come to learn from you?<br>
  OS:</b></font> Because they like my dancing and mostly because they consider
  me the best teacher. Most of them are non-latinos and they appreciate the time
  I take not only to teach them the dance but to understand the music.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>SNY: Are most of
  your students men or women? and why is that?<br>
  OS: </b></font>I would say they are equally divided.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">What
  is the hardest thing you find about teaching?</font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000"><br>
  OS:</font></b> To keep the students challenged; without the challenge of
  something new interest is quickly lost. Equally difficult is to try to control
  someone who wants to learn advanced stuff without mastering the basics.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000">SNY: Do you still
  like to go to clubs and dance socially?<br>
  OS:</font></b> I don't go to clubs as much. I've developed an intolerance for
  smoky environments, pushing and shoving, and not being able to sit unless I
  buy drinks at exorbitant prices.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">How
  about performing? Do you still perform and who have you performed for or with?</font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000"><br>
  OS:</font></b> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've had in the past given
  demonstrations for the school during &quot;guest night&quot; and different
  other occasions such as special workshops but I've never felt compelled to
  perform as I dance purely for pleasure and not to prove anything to anybody.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>SNY: What do you
  look for in a song when you are putting choreography together for it?<br>
  OS:</b></font> Exciting music.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>SNY: Have you
  traveled to teach workshops and seminars? If so where have you gone?<br>
  OS: </b></font>I've been invited to Baltimore and Berlin but never went.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#800000"><b>SNY: Which gives you
  the best joy? Teaching, performing or putting together choreography?<br>
  OS:</b></font> Teaching.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">How
  is it that you prepare yourself for a workshop? and for a performance?<br>
  </font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000">OS:</font></b>
  Nothing terribly special. Just make sure that the routine meets a<br>
  certain standard of quality.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">What
  advice would you give those just getting into mambo? How can they work at
  getting better at dancing?&nbsp;<br>
  </font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000">OS:</font></b>
  Learn the basics well and learn to understand the music if you've never been
  exposed to it before. Anybody can do a lot of crazy turn patterns and steps
  but very few do it with style and grace. Conversely, many good dancers do a
  minimum of stuff on the dance floor but they do it with aplomb and finesse.
  The thing that is going to make your dance the most beautiful is the sense of
  knowing what you are doing. That's when you don't have to think about what you
  are doing so that everything just &quot;flows.&quot; Only practice can get you
  there.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY: </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">How
  is New York Mambo Dancing different from mambo dancing in other parts of the
  country?</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
  OS:</font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It appears to be more
  refined and almost elevated to a sports category.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
  <b><font color="#800000">SNY: </font></b></font><b><font color="#800000"></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000">Do
  you think that dancers get treated with respect? If not why?<br>
  OS:</font></b> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">In my personal experience,
  yes. I can feel the respect and admiration from other people and in general
  people respect anybody that is good at what they do.</font></p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000"><font size="2" face="Verdana">SNY:</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">
  What would you like to see happen to mambo within the next few years?, next
  decade? within your lifetime?</font></font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#800000"><br>
  OS: </font></b>I would like it to spread to every part of the world so that
  it's known and danced in every corner of the globe.</font></p>
