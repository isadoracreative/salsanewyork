        article about the history of salsa music but also as an approach to the
        questions about &quot;who's music is it: Cuba, Puerto Rico or New York??&quot;

        London, Tuesday, 09 February 1999</font><b></p>
        </b>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the most hotly
        debated issues around Salsa is where its from and who owns it; in a
        recently reissued song, Pio Leyva sings, &quot;if they talk to you about
        Salsa, lies, its called <i>Son</i>&quot; (<i>si te hablan de la
        salsa, mentira, se llama son</i>). I can now reveal the answer is to
        this is  IT DEPENDS. It really depends on how you are looking at it.
        Are you tracing history of the rhythms back to their roots (how far back
        do you go, it could go on forever) or you could look for the people who
        developed it, or the people who consume it and keep the demand going.
        You could argue that Salsa is Caribbean because thats where the
        rhythms came from, or maybe from New York because they jazzed up the<i>
        Son </i>and called it Salsa. Or you could argue that it belongs to all
        the people who dance and listen to Salsa from Japan, LA, London, San
        Juan to &quot;el quinto pino&quot;, or the ends of the earth.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But often when people ask,
        &quot;where does salsa comes from&quot; they want an answer based on
        nationality, geography and ethnicity. What Ive done here is to go
        through some literature on Salsa, which sheds some light on the
        question. The ideas fall under three main headings:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Musical roots.</font></b></li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Transplanted music.</font></b></li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Trans-national
            music.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Musical roots.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Salsa draws on several
        Afro-Latin genres, among the most important influences is<i> </i>Cuban<i>
        Son Montuno</i>, from which salsa gets its rhythms (e.g. clave, and <i>matriz</i>
        &quot;taka taka taka gun&quot;) and <i>son</i>g structure (canto -
        montuno) which <i>Son </i>derived<i> </i>from <i>Rumba. </i>Salsa also
        drew indirectly on another Cuban musical family <i>Danzon / Mambo.</i>
        So Cuban music and musicians have been especially important to
        &quot;Salsa&quot;. But there is furious debate around this, which I will
        look at by describing the contribution of the Cuban sources from which
        Salsa was created.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Son.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Son</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">
        is an Afro Cuban music, which originated a century ago in Oriente,
        eastern Cuba, (Santiago is often quoted).<i> Son </i>drew on African and
        European musics but was predominantly played by and for Afro-Cubans and
        was considered vulgar by the elite. <i>Son </i>arrived in Havana (which
        was reputedly less racist) around 1909 and despite its association with
        the poor it began to attract following of white upper classes. This
        coincided with an increased interest and respect for Afro-Cubanismo
        inspired by authors like Fernando Ortiz. This respect was seen later
        with the &quot;re-Africanisation&quot; of <i>Son</i> by people like<i> </i>Arsenio
        Rodriguez in using the conga drum which had formerly been a rejected
        symbol of lower class black culture.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Son</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">'s
        two-part structure<i> </i>features verses, which set out a theme,
        followed by a call and response section of lyrical and musical
        improvisations on the theme. This structure allowed son to incorporate
        other genres, e.g. guajira-<i>son</i>, bolero-<i>son</i> etc and this
        gave Son a wide appeal in Cuba, which was also helped by it<i></i>s
        celebration of the everyday life of Cubas poor. <i>Son </i>became
        popular throughout Cuba around 1920 when Miguel Matamoros copyrighted
        the first <i>Son</i>, &quot;<i>Mama Son de la loma</i>&quot;.
        International popularity followed in the 1930s when Don Azpiazu's
        orchestra performed Moises Simons<i> Son </i>&quot;El Manisero&quot;
        at the Chicago world fare. This gave rise to the US &quot;rhumba
        craze&quot; of the 1930s. So in 30 years<i> Son </i>went from being an
        obscure regional performance mainly produced by poor black musicians, to
        a national symbol of Cuba and &quot;international pop phenomenon&quot;.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rumba.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rumba </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">was<i>
        </i>Havanas parallel to Oriente's <i>Son</i>. Traditional <i>Rumba</i>
        is an Afro Cuban genre, which emerged in the 1890s it featured
        percussion and voices and the best known variety (guaguanco) represents
        a sexual conquest. It was also associated with poor Afro Cubans and like
        other aspects of Afro Cuban culture was often suppressed. Afro Cubans
        faced prosecution for street performances of box drums and ñañigo <i>Rumba</i>s.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">However the restriction of
        Afro Cuban and traditional forms didnt extend to cabaret music, and
        the cabaret <i>Rumba</i> flourished during the US prohibition era when
        Cuba attracted US tourists. This was a greatly changed <i>Rumba</i> of
        lewd &quot;sainetes&quot; (short plays) which portrayed racial
        stereotypes to a racially segregated male audience. The music was not
        always <i>Rumba</i> but featured caricatured <i>rumberas. </i>Moore
        suggest that this parody especially belittled Afro Cuban music.
        References to black culture were in the lyrics not the music, through
        singing about poor areas in a mock black dialect.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">During this period <i>Rumba</i>
        was suppressed while<i> Son </i>gradually became seen as the essence of
        Cuba, &quot;<i>Cubanisimo&quot;.</i> So Moore sees the history of <i>Rumba</i>
        and<i> Son </i>as the struggle of Cubans to come to term with their
        cultural diversity and to create a national unity. The acceptance of
        Afro-Cuban performers as <i>Son</i>eros but not as Rumberos led to an
        increasing disguising of <i>Rumba</i> within<i> Son </i>as musicians
        adapted to middle class Cuban and international tastes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The mixing of two genres
        can be seen in song lyrics, through the 1930s and 1950s, references to
        Guaguanco increased, <i>Sones</i> with little Afro Cuban percussion,
        referred&nbsp;to <i>Rumba</i> in lyrics. In the mid 1940s traditional <i>Rumba</i>
        was re-appropriated by black artists and came to be celebrated as a
        self-confident expression of black culture and <i>Rumba</i> rhythms
        began to appear within Son and Mambo; the Guaguanco in particular became
        seen as a source of authenticity.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Danzon &amp; Mambo</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Danzon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">
        emerged as a stylised derivative of the genteel <i>contradanza (habanera</i>)
        which was derived from the <i>charanga </i>or<i> tumba francesa</i>.
        This came to Cuba with refugees from the Haitian revolution. By 1920 the
        genre had become <i>Danzon </i>and featured flute, violins, piano,
        string bass, timbales and güiro. <i>Danzon</i> used a <i>habanera</i>
        bassline, a violin <i>&quot;guajeo&quot; </i>(the repeated phrase which
        is usually played on piano)<i> </i>and<i> </i>despite its more European
        sound D<i>anzon</i> was a Creole genre and often played for the white
        urban elite by black musicians.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1938 Orestes Lopez (Cachaos
        brother) from Arcaño's band composed a <i>danzon</i> called &quot;<i>Mambo</i>&quot;
        which had a fast improvised section at the end. Arcaño added a conga to
        the ensemble, replaced the<i> habanera</i> bass with a <i>Son </i>bass
        and the played the timbales pattern on the <i>cencerro</i> (cow bell),
        so the new music now had feel of<i> Son </i>but was in three parts. Soon
        <i>charanga ensembles adopted Danzon-Mambo</i>, and when separate M<i>ambo</i>s
        were recorded without the preceding <i>Danzon</i> section, a new genre
        was formed which was eventually to rival the international popularity of
        S<i>on</i>.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Transplanted music.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the 1930s<i> Son </i>had
        become popular throughout the Hispanic Caribbean, through live
        performances, radio, recordings and film. This popularity emerged from
        common cultural disposition created by similar histories of colonisation:
        slavery, sugar and tobacco economies and the influence of African and
        Iberian cultural forms.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So<i> Son </i>went from
        being a very local Cuban style to one which transcended cultural and
        geographical boundaries. A particularly important tie has been between
        Puerto Rican and Cuban genres. An often-quoted poem has the line: <i>&quot;Cuba
        and Puerto Rico are the two wings of the same bird&quot;</i> and
        throughout their history the two countries have had close links and
        similar histories. But because of Puerto Rico's geography, size and
        position it had a different experience of colonial rule, e.g. the ethnic
        mix was different because Cuba's indigenous population were wiped out,
        also Puerto Rico had proportionately fewer Africans and hence Cuba had a
        more robust and visible Afro-Latin culture. But both countries felt a
        need to distance themselves from the colonial influence of Spain and the
        emerging influence of the US. In Cuba black musical expression
        especially <i>Son </i>served this purpose, and Cuban genres also helped
        in Puerto Rico. They had been accepted there since early days e.g.
        contradanza, bolero and guaracha were adopted and became symbols of
        Puerto Rican nationalism.</font></p>
        <i>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bomba and Plena</font></p>
        </i>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Puerto Rican national
        identity is especially important because many Puerto Ricans feel they
        have not had independence since the 1490s and they have often seen
        themselves in contrast with their colonisers. Music has been
        symbolically important in this, so<i> Son </i>and later Salsa were
        embraced as local genres, which confidently contrasted with Spanish and
        US music. Local Puerto Rican music like Bomba and Plena are important in
        Puerto Rico as folk genres and as influences in Salsa, but didnt get
        the same mass popularity as Salsa perhaps because they were not
        established national musics. Mon Rivera, Rafael Cortijo, his wonderful
        singer Ismael Rivera, were the most recent popular champions of Bomba
        and Plena. But their music was really Cubanised, it used the conjunto
        ensemble, instrumentation and often featured a<i> Son clave</i>,<i> Son </i>bass
        and <i>guajeo</i> over local rhythms. Also the repertoire of the bands
        which emerged from the break up Cortijos combo, e.g. Cortijo's &quot;Bonche&quot;,
        &quot;El Gran Combo&quot;, and Ismael Rivera's &quot;Cachimbos&quot; all
        produced far more Salsa than <i>Bomba</i> or <i>Plena</i>. So basically
        the contribution of Puerto Rican <b>people </b>to salsa has been much
        greater than the influence of Puerto Rican <b>music</b> to Salsa.
        (Having said that where would Salsa be without Ismael Rivera, El Gran
        Combo, Cortijo, Mon Rivera, La Sonora Ponceña, Libre, Willie Colon,
        Willie Rosario, Gilberto Santa Rosa to name a few).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a counter
        argument that challenges the exclusive Cuban roots of Salsa. This
        suggests that Salsa is pan Latin and diverse incorporating many styles
        of which<i> Son </i>is only one. Some people suggest that Plena was as
        influential to Salsa as Son and that Salsa is very different from Afro
        Cuban music, in its instrumentation, tempo, arrangements and subject
        matter. It is hard to resolve these arguments, certainly Puerto
        Ricanisms in Salsa are more subtle than the Cubanisms but they are
        there. Sometimes a bomba pattern is played on a cencerro, or a song has
        a &quot;lelolai&quot; introduction or they are singing about rural
        jibaros, or Christmas <i>aguinaldos</i>. But before we even consider
        settling the Cuban - Puerto Rican debate theres another argument
        which presents &quot;Salsa&quot; as neither Cuban nor Puerto Rican but
        North American; a product of New York where the<i> Son </i>became Salsa
        and gained a new significance.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Trans-national music</font></p>
        </b>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The USA has been important
        to the development of Salsa for several reasons. Firstly, along with
        Spain, the USA provided a symbol of colonialism to be reacted against,
        in the cultural world this lead to a greater acceptance of Afro-Latin
        musics, which might otherwise have remained marginal.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The US has been a major
        consumer of Latin music not only through tourism as was seen in cabaret <i>Rumba</i>,
        but also in the <i>&quot;rhumba craze&quot;</i> of the thirties (see
        above) followed by the popularity of the <i>Mambo and Chachachá, </i>which
        the<i> </i>USA helped to distribute. We often think of Latin music being
        exported to the USA, but Waxer argues that this was a two way process.
        The US influence in Cuban music is seen in the use of trumpets in <i>Son
        </i>and the Jazz influenced big band styles of Benny More among others.
        New Orleans was also closely linked culturally to the Caribbean in its
        past and in particular to Havana.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps the most important
        US influence on salsa has been as home to many Latin musicians, which
        led to new music, combining the New York experience with the original
        Caribbean sources. The Puerto Rican population of New York was
        particularly important to Salsa. In his obituary to Jerry Masucci,
        founder of Fania, Larry Harlow described Salsa's growth in NYC as a
        response to the reduced availability of Cuban music after the Cuban
        revolution, which led New York Latins to reproduce Cuban music for the
        new local setting. Waxer suggests that the transnational development of <i>Son,
        Danzon, Mambo </i>and<i> Chachachá</i> set the stage for the creation
        of a pan-Latin American cultural identity, and that this musical
        appropriation is linked into the development of a new social identity.
        Furthermore Manuel adds that in this process of creative appropriation
        and reformation that the original roots and ethnic associations can
        actually become irrelevant to the new identity being formed.</font></p>
        <b>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion?</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no conclusion to
        this ongoing debate, Salsa is a trans-national genre, which draws on
        many other genres. Whats more interesting to me is not deciding who
        is right or wrong (which is impossible) but being aware of and
        respecting the many different contributions to the argument, and
        enjoying the many wonderful contributions to the music. Ive touched
        on some of the issues. But I havent even had time to mention the
        relationship between Salsa and Calypso, Mento and Merengue or the
        contributions of Miami, mainland Latin America, e.g. Venezuela and
        Colombia or even African, European and Asian contributions which have
        all played a role in the creation of Salsa.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So a simple question like
        &quot;wheres salsa from&quot; leads us to questions like &quot;what
        is nationality&quot;, &quot;what is ethnicity&quot; and &quot;what is
        identity&quot; and the idea of a music moving around the world and
        forming a joint pop culture. Its not a simple subject, you could do a
        PhD on it (as I am) and still not find a definitive answer. So now, when
        people ask me &quot;wheres salsa from&quot;, I say &quot;If youve
        got a couple of weeks, I can start to explain, but wouldnt you rather
        dance instead?&quot;</font></p>
