Its been a little over a year since the David Melendez's Heartbreak Boyz first
hit the NY Mambo Dance scene. From the very start, the won the hearts of the NY
dance community. To this day, this group of well behave young men can be scene
dancing up a storm at many of NY Social Dances. It was while I was cleaning out
my dusty article file that I found this little article put together by David
Melendez on his &quot;Heartbreak Boyz&quot;. Its been a full year, the kids
found come and conquered, traveled to Toronto, California, Japan and back. They
even help spawn a younger version of themselves The Junior Heartbreak Boyz. I
think that even David didn't realize how successful his team of young dancers
were going to be. Congrats to the Heartbreak Boyz for helping to carry mambo in
the year 2000 and plus! - Manny</font><em><strong><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><big><big><big><br>

six young teenage boys in New York that have been put together to form a dance
group. Jason Rivera, Isaac Crespo, Edwin Rivera, Jerome Ramos, Jonathan Rosado
&amp; William Sanchez. Together we called the Heartbreak Boyz. They started
performing throughout the city in March.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Their debut as a team was during a party held
for the <a href="http://starlitedance.com/">Starlite Dance Studio </a>on
Saturday, March 18, 2000. This show was of course in front of their friends and
family members, which made the whole event very comfortable and enjoyable. Then
came the approval of the NY/NJ mambo community. Their next performance was at
Mad About Mambo held by the <a href="http://www.mambomamas.com/">Mambo Mamas</a>.
They performed well and the boys were beginning to get their feet wet after a
few more performances in NY/NJ like <a href="../../calendar.htm">Bernards
Social, Fuerza Latinas Social &amp; Mambo Nites.</a> Then came their first
show away from home.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In April the boys went to Toronto to be part of
the Salsaweb 2<sup>nd</sup> International Salsa Convention. While in Toronto the
boys not only felt good about their performance but also how the public was
accepting them as peers. On their second getaway trip the boys went to Los
Angeles to be part of Albert Torres West Coast Salsa Congress. They had the time
of their young lives while in LA. They performed and danced with different
people from around the world. They hung out by the pool and did a little tour of
the city. I must say that each heartbreaker had a great time in LA and are
looking forward to being part of that wonderful event again next year.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Plans are being worked on so that they can
travel to Japan and experience another different culture. Japans salsa scene
has grown in the last few years and myself with the people from Japan are trying
to set up a<b><i> &quot;Heartbreak Boys Japan Tour&quot; </i></b>for November of
2000. During the summer the boys will be performing in many places around the
city. Their first fundraiser will be on Saturday, July 29 where they will
perform their second number, which in fact is being choreographed by the
heartbreak boys themselves. Of course I am there to help in the process and make
sure that the routine runs smooth. Im sure the public will love their second
routine as much as their first.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Heartbreak Boys are now very well known and
also well loved and we look forward to seeing all six boys grow and become a big
part of the Mambo Community. They have made their mark and are here to stay and
we look forward to a lot of great things from them in the future.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A special note: There will be a Jr. Heartbreak
Boys coming in the future. Six young boys have been chosen to be part of this
team and all are under 12 years old. We look forward to their debut.</font></p>
