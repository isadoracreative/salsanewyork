  Alright, call it a pet peeve.&nbsp; Another pet peeve.&nbsp; Ive been
  watching some of the younger male hot shot dancers doing these steps
  that disturb me.&nbsp; I dont know if theyre picking them up in dance
  classes.&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp; I mean, I hope that teachers have enough good
  sense not to teach this stuff.<br>
  <br>
  What Im referring to is a trend toward steps that have nothing to do with
  dancing and, at best, I believe are demeaning, disrespectful, and potentially
  painful to their partners.&nbsp; The one I find most offensive is where the
  guy with his back turned to the woman kicks his foot out backward, karate
  style, to catch his partner in the crook of his bent leg and turn her.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  He then hops onto that foot and uses his free foot to catch her going in the
  other direction and send her back, all the while with his back turned.&nbsp;
  Looks way cool, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Actually, what it looks like is a dog doing a number on a fire hydrant.<br>
  <br>
  The other day I saw one of these better dancers flick his foot out
  behind him and inadvertently kick his short partner with the point of his
  foot, catching her right in her lower back in the area of her kidney.&nbsp;
  Ouch! That had to hurt. You could see her wince in pain, but she kept on
  dancing and said nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; He, of course, with his back to her was
  oblivious to it all, he was so..o..o..o&nbsp; cool.<br>
  <br>
  Then theres one where the guy squats down and turns his partner by her
  knees.&nbsp; Try losing sight of your partner and feel someone swatting at
  your legs while you turn helplessly with no frame of reference.&nbsp; How much
  fun is that?<br>
  <br>
  How about that step where the guy leads a cross-body and simultaneously turns
  the woman counterclockwise by forcing her head down from her neck to pass her
  under his arm.&nbsp; Why is that one so popular?&nbsp; Why are women willing
  to dance with men who do that.&nbsp; Especially, since women Ive talked to
  hate that step.&nbsp; At best it musses their hair, at worst it hurts their
  neck.<br>
  <br>
  There are several other steps Ive seen that really dont do much for the
  women except put them at risk of injury.<br>
  <br>
  Now, Its one thing to work out a step as choreography and get the timing
  and sequencing down so that everyone knows whats happening when.&nbsp; Then
  you rehearse it until you and your partner are comfortable with it and can
  pretty much do it with your eyes closed.&nbsp; Thats fine for performing,<br>
  <br>
  But, good dancing is about communication.&nbsp; So, dont spring these moves
  on your partner when youre out dancing socially.&nbsp;&nbsp; And above all,
  use some common sense - dont risk hurting or demeaning your partner just to
  impress your friends.<br>
