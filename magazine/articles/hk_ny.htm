                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This past December 9-16, 1999
                  I fulfilled my childhood dream of visiting Hong Kong and the
                  beautiful thing was that it wall all due to Salsa Dancing.
                  Yes, people in Hong Kong love to dance Salsa too. The Hong
                  Kong scene, though still young, has been growing over the last
                  few years. I was offered a chance to travel there by New York
                  Mambo &quot;Chinita&quot; Winsome Lee, who had relocated to
                  Hong Kong for a couple of months to teach NY style of mambo
                  dancing.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">My trip to Hong Kong was a
                  really long, but a comfortable one. I was lucky enough to have
                  my own row during the flight. Thank god I decided to bring my
                  own entertainment (books, magazines, writing pad, laptop, CD
                  player). I would have gone batty with nothing to do, since I
                  had seen all 3 of the in-flight movies they were showing on
                  board. Several magazines and one book later we had arrived to
                  Japan for a brief stop-over. It gave me enough time to check
                  out the local airport. I hear that Japan is an awesome Salsa
                  town. Too bad that I didnt have the time to check it out
                  personally, but there is always a next time. 8-). My only word
                  of advice for those traveling Salseros visiting
                  Japan......dont eat the rubber-like tasting hot
                  dogs.....they suck big time!!! The coffee and sandwiches were
                  okay, but that hot dog (the little I eat of it) haunted me for
                  a couple of hours. Nuff said.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was great to see <a href="../instructors/winsome_lee.htm"><b>Winsome</b></a>
                  when I <b>FINALLY</b> arrived in Hong Kong. I hadnt seen
                  her since last summer. She was one of my teammates during our
                  Mam-fu performance at the <b><a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/danceco_manny_s_mam_fu.htm">1999
                  Congreso Mundial de la Salsa in San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>.</b>
                  Through her contacts Winsome had managed to get me travel
                  arrangements to HK so that I could help her promote her
                  classes and workshops. I wasnt the first NY partner to
                  visit her homeland in the short amount she had been living
                  there. Mambo Instructors <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm"><b>Jimmy
                  Anton</b></a> and <a href="../instructors/carlos_vasquez.htm"><b>Carlos
                  Konig</b></a> were part of the New York &quot;invasion&quot;
                  that preceded me. We had a lot of catching up to do. So after
                  a quick bite at the airport, we took this really cool
                  ultra-modern train that transported us from the airport (which
                  is HUGE ) to the heart of the city of Hong Kong. It was
                  midnight, so we decided to take a quick cab ride to
                  Winsomes home. The rest of the night was spent talking and
                  practicing till wee-hours in the morning.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I got up early the next
                  morning (before Winsome, Im proud to say), forcing myself
                  to be on HK local time. Winsomes Mom (a mega cool person),
                  had some breakfast waiting for us. She even made me some hot
                  tea with milk which I found myself craving for during the rest
                  of the trip (It was awesome and this is coming from a die-hard
                  coffee lover....me). From Winsomes home (which was up in
                  the hills close by to the city ) I got to see what the Hong
                  Kong looks like during the day. Everything is really close and
                  condense. The best way for me to describe it would be to say
                  that Hong Kong has the skyscrapers of New York with the hills
                  of San Francisco. The buildings there look like giant
                  chop-sticks rammed into the ground shooting up toward the sky
                  and out of the valley.</font></p>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately there was little time
          for me to sightsee that first day. I spent the day rehearing, cabbing
          from one spot to the next, helping Winsome teach a couple of Workshops
          and finally performing at The International Salsa Dance Party. It was
          my first glimpse of the local salsa scene. Our performance went over
          well and so did Winsomes workshop which was a relief for me since I
          wanted her to look good. The local Salseros I met there seemed very
          friendly. HK is mainly an on &quot;1&quot; town, that is until Winsome
          showed up. In the few short months, she has created a small core group
          of dancers that break on &quot;2&quot;. But instead of creating a
          timing war (the 1 vs the 2), Winsome had projected an environment of
          mutual respect &amp; cooperation with the other instructors. This I
          think has tremendously benefitted the melting pot of dancers that make
          up their local dance pool. Its great to see Europeans, Americans,
          Black, Indonesians, Asians and Hispanics all gathered in one place
          because of their love of Salsa Dancing. <b>Several of the local
          dancers I met were students of Winsome; others were local instructors
          (like Joseph Ennin, Wilma Donnelly, Cliff Hall, Frank &amp; his
          partner Chris Wong).</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I did manage to mingle a little bit
          with the locals on my first day. Winsome took me into the Hong Kong
          Metro (subway) system for a ride. And what a beautiful system it is
          too. From what I understand its only 20 some odd years old at this
          time. The trains seemed quick and quiet (unlike NY). The people were
          in a rush and would collide into you, then keep walking (just like
          NY). It was great. I felt like I was back home. 8-). Then I noticed
          that everyone was carrying cell phones. I mean everyone had one. 4 out
          of 5 people seem be talking on them. Im surprised that people
          didnt have them grafted onto their ears. I even heard phones go off
          while traveling in the subway cars and we were several stories
          underground. Which led me to believe that either they had a better
          phone system then ours or they were all going to die of brain cancer
          from the frequency used there.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of my trip evenly mixed
          sightseeing with salsa dancing. Winsome was the perfect host, by now
          having perfected her tour guide skills due to the previous visits of
          Carlos and Jimmy. We covered the city by cab, train, trolley,
          mini-bus, ferry, car and on foot. My sightseeing experiences included
          a visit to Repulse Bay, which was the home of many Buddha statues. We
          were joined by Winsomes Mom who also took me to eat at a couple of
          nice HK restaurants like the one located inside the Soccer Club. Then
          there was my shopping adventure in Hong Kongs Time Square building
          which is sort of a shopping mall. It was here that I finally found my
          first real cup of coffee...thank God!!!. The Times Square area also
          provided me with an opportunity to do some Christmas shopping. We also
          journeyed on a 100 year old trolley car that carried us to THE PEAK (a
          tourist attraction that overlooks all of Hong Kong). The city was
          filled with many familiar storefront sights like McDonalds, 711 and
          TGIY that would make any American feel at home. It was nothing like I
          expected. <b>I had this Hollywood movie image of the city, with
          rickshaw drivers running up and down the street, clotheslines hung up
          between buildings and people living on Junks (a type of boat) by the
          river. For those of you that are Bruce Lee fans, just think of the
          opening scene of &quot;ENTER THE DRAGON&quot; and youll get the
          picture. </b>Speaking of Bruce Lee, those who know me, also know that
          he was a childhood idol of mine. It was because of him that I got
          involved in the martial arts, which led me to become a martial artist,
          an instructor, author of several martial arts training videos, books,
          magazine articles and finally into my present career as a Stunt
          Coordinator/Stuntman. No trip to Hong Kong would have been complete
          for me without doing something related to Bruce Lee. This prompted
          Winsome to take me to visit <b>La Salle </b>(a school where both Bruce
          &amp; Brandon Lee went to) and <b>The Bruce Lee Café </b>(thats
          right a theme restaurant name after the man himself).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hong Kong proved to be a very modern
          city. There was construction going on everywhere. Wherever I went I
          could scaffolding running up alongside many buildings. I hear that the
          skyline has changed drastically over the last ten years. I think the
          Chinese motto should be &quot;OUT with the old and IN with the
          new&quot;. I managed to really appreciate the Hong Kong skyline to its
          fullest when Winsome took me to eat at the Regent Hotel. It was on
          that side of the river where people could see all the buildings light
          up when it got dark outside. Lets just say that its the Hong Kong
          version of New Yorks Time Square. Huge neon signs for companies
          like Sony, Toshiba and Ford would like up on top of buildings. Very
          commercial, but breath taking all the same time.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Can you believe with all this
          sightseeing that I still had time for dancing. Well I did. There was a
          different place to salsa dance for each day of the week. I hit some
          local hot spots like La Placita Restaurant, The Havana Club and The
          Tea Room. The Placita Restaurant was the site for the 1<sup>st</sup>
          Hong Kong Salsa Competition. Winsome, along with Salsaweb Hong Kong
          Correspondent Ricci Yasin were among the judges present at the event.
          It was really nice to see the locals dance up a storm. I loved to see
          them perform. You could really tell that they put their hearts into
          it. I was really happy for Winsome since the first place winners (Lina
          &amp; Jean Pierre) had been coached by her, and the second place
          winners (Olivier &amp; Diane) were students of her. On another night I
          visited a club called the Tea Room. It was there that local salsa
          instructors <b>Wilma Donnelly &amp; Cliff Hall </b>invited me to teach
          some partner work. Students at the Tea Room were very eager to pick up
          new material. So I gave them a couple of turn patterns for them to
          happily digest. Wilma also interviewed me for a magazine she and Cliff
          Hall edit called <b>Sonando Magazine</b>. Sonando is a free bi-monthly
          periodical that covers the Hong Kong Salsa dance scene. Copies of
          Sonando can be found at all the local salsa clubs. Its a great
          resource guide for those salseros living or visiting there. Those
          interested in finding out more about Sonando Magazine can surf on over
          to:<b> <a href="http://www.clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/hongkongsalsa">www.clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/hongkongsalsa</a>

                  <b>The Havana Club</b> which will always conjure pleasant
                  memories for me. Its a Salsa club that Winsome and I, along
                  with a couple of other local Salseros hit the night before I
                  headed back to the States. For all intents and purposes it was
                  not a schedule salsa night, but our little crew made it into
                  one. The best part for me was this ongoing game I had with
                  Winsome, where she would try to snatch one of the Havanas
                  drink mixer from my hand. She tried everything in her power to
                  take it from me. The funny part, was that it had to be the
                  very one I was holding. A duplicate wouldnt do. So I teased
                  her the rest of the night by switching them and letting her
                  believe she had succeeded taking it from me. She never did. I
                  still have it. As part of the tease I e-mailed her a scan copy
                  of it, with a promise to give it to her upon her return to NY.
                  Now that shes back, I guess Im going to have to live up
                  to my end of the promise. 8-)</font></td>

          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, my time in Hong Kong finally
          ended. I got up at 4:35am, was served my last cup of hot tea with milk
          from Winsome and jumped on a cab that took me to the train station.
          There I checked my luggage, said my goodbyes to Winsome and thanked
          her for the wonderful time I had during my visit. I had a blast. <b>This
          is one trip Ill never forget. As Bob Hope would say, (Winsome)
          .......&quot;thanks for the memories.&quot; I also want to take this

          befriended me and did their best to make me feel at home.</b> The
