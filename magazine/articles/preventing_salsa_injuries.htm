  Salsa Injuries</font><br>
  - </i></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by Dafina Biteye</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is
  it important for you to attend the next salsa event, mambo class, or social?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Does<br>
  the thought of sitting around nursing an injury just piss you off?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>If so then its likely to be important to keep your dancing machine
  in good working condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The repetitive moves, crowded dance floors, dancing in heels,
  body awareness, dance skills, and your history of physical wellness are some
  of the factors you need to take into consideration in order to help prevent
  injuries.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <br>
  <br>
  One factor is repetitive moves, which can be turns, or going over and over
  shines or a sequence during a class or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>rehearsal.
  By doing repetitive moves you get a chance to learn the movement but you get a
  good chance of over working a specific group of muscles..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This over works<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
  muscles used and can lead to muscle strain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A strained muscle can knot up and go into spasm leading to localized
  pain, swelling and a decrease in the range of motion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If you happen to over work a joint injuring connective tissue there
  its more likely to tear a ligament causing a sprain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A sprain will cause you will feel a sharp pain followed by rapid
  swelling. Sprains more easily occur at your knees, ankles and along the spinal
  column of your back.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Old
  injuries can contribute to limited range of motion, muscle spasms, atrophy of
  muscle leading to weakness in muscle groups or joints making you more
  susceptible to injury.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Accidents
  and trauma, these<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>acute
  occurrences can lead to chronic conditions of pain and discomfort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It is possible to feel as if the injury caused by the accident has
  healed then sometime down the line a seemingly unrelated discomfort or painful
  conditions arise.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Stress
  can lead to both emotional and muscular tension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Tension blocks the free smooth flow of energy and blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Improper posture while sitting at the computer or talking on the phone
  or an improper height for your desk or chair can contribute to muscular
  tension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of people dance to
  get rid of tension and help manage stress, which is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>excellent to do,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There are times when there is to much in your dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Tension can contribute to making you less aware of the dance floor or
  your partner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dancing
  is in itself a risk factor for injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  order to be safe on the dance floor defensive measure are necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Dancing with someone who leads you to strongly can lead to shoulder and
  upper back injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dancing with
  someone who leads you all over the place with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>turns on a crowded dance floor can lead you into collision course with
  other dancers and throw you off your center. Dancers have come away from the
  dance after someone has stepped on the top of their feet causing black and
  blue marks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dancing with a
  partner who is not sensitive to your level can be another accident waiting to
  happen..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is important to take
  classes to develop a level of skill and safe sensible habits on the dance
  floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have so many wonderful
  teachers take advantage of their knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>As a women if you feel that someone is on the dangerous side politely
  decline to dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While in
  a class if you find that guys<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>are
  executing movements that cause you discomfort then bring that to the attention
  of the instructor for clarification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
  can verbally communicate your concern to your partner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>And finally you can stop dancing in order to protect yourself. There
  will be another song and another partner soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Excessive
  weight is another risk factor --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>61%
  of adults in this country are obese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>We do see some overweight salsaros and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>salsaras on the dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>The extra weight puts extra stress on all of your weight bearing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>joints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That extra weight
  can contribute to chronic back pain and extra stress of the knees and ankles.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lets
  look at some things that can help you stay on the dance floor more safely
  longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stretching exercises and
  yoga helps to move blood and energy to and through the muscles while helping
  your flexibility. Range of motion exercises are important, especially if you
  have prior injuries to a joint. Range of motion exercises help to supply blood
  to a joint.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you have an area that has been weaken then it's important
  to do strengthen that area .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Relaxation,
  breathing or meditation can be helpful if you feel<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>emotionally stressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  is a good idea to exercise the feet, pointing and flexing at the ankle and
  curling the toes helps with strength and flexibility of the feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Wearing the proper shoe is important as well as shoes which provide
  good support for the ankles<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Properly
  hydrating with water when doing a lot of dancing helps to move toxins produced
  by the activity out of the muscles.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If
  you happen to incur an injury it is very important to handle it well to
  quicken the recovery time and protect yourself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>from developing a chronic condition. An acute injury calls for the
  first aid application of RICE, and a visit to your physician if the injury
  warrants it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>RICE is an acronym which stands for R-rest, I-ice,
  C-compression, E-elevation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
  your body sends you those pain signals it is demanding that you discontinue
  whatever you are doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
  important to listen to your body say stop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Something is wrong now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
  you force yourself to work through that pain you can make your condition
  worst. A ligament tear may be able to heal with a few days rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, if you insist on dancing on that painful ankle today next week
  surgery may be needed to repair the damage. I have seen people damage
  themselves into a life time disability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
  an injury avoid anything that causes pain.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Immediately
  after an injury apply cold in any form you can get your hands. An ice pack is
  ideal, cold water, cold paper towels, ice cream, frozen vegetables will do
  temporarily.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Use clothing or a piece of cloth to protect the skin from
  direct contact with the ice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  ice constricts the blood vessels which reduce the localized bleeding and
  swelling .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ice also helps prevent
  the muscles from going into spasm..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  average time to ice is 20 minuets. You can damage the skin and nerve ending
  with prolonged exposure to ice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  the bony areas of the wrists and ankles application of ice can be 10 to 15
  minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the
  injury you can apply ice every two hours the first day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The following days you can apply ice at regular intervals 4 to 5 times
  a day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to
  ice the first 1 to 3 days following an injury. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Compression
  is the application of an ace bandage, or wrap.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Compression prevents fluid accumulation, reduces swelling and pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Use the elastic wraps to prevent causing to much constriction cutting
  off circulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elevation
  of the injured area above the level of the heart can help reduce swelling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The purpose of the RICE is to provide the body with the mechanism to
  reduce swelling at the injured site quickly which in turn speeds up recovery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Swelling can cause damage to the cells which contributes to pain,
  muscle spasms and limited range of motion. It is of the upmost importance to
  ice to get rid of that swelling quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Once the swelling has been reduced the energy and blood can<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>move more freely through out the body. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I
  want to recommend two items that are very helpful for pain conditions ranging
  from soreness from over exertion to severe pain of an injury. The two items
  are homeopathic <i><b>Arnica</b></i> (see <a href="#Editors">Editior's Note &amp; 
  Warning</a> below) and Traumeel .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
  are homeopathic over the counter preparations. Homeopathy is a form of
  medicine that uses very small amounts of a substance to stimulate the bodys
  own defenses to heal. Homeopathic remedies can safely be used by all ages and
  do not interfere<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>with the action of supplements or medications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Homeopathic remedies lose potency when touched, taken after eating
  onion, garlic or using mint flavored toothpaste or strong smells like Vicks
  Vaporub. Homeopathic remedies provide you with a healing energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Arnica specifically relieves pain, stiffness, and swelling
  associated with minor falls, blows, bruises, sprains, and strains, simple back
  aches, sports injuries, and over exercising, and makes black and blue marks go
  away faster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can ingest
  arnica pellets and/or use an arnica gel topically on unbroken skin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>You can use arnica after overworking your muscles and after an injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Traumeel contains arnica, in addition, to other homeopathic remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It too is used to relieve pain, inflammation, and swelling for acute
  and chronic conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  arnica comes in different potencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  is recommended that you use 6c or 12c potency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>The Traumeel does not come in different potencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I do suggest you keep both on hand as a part of your first aid kit.

  <font color="#FF0000"><b><a name="Editors">Editor's</a> Note &amp; Warning:</b></font></u>&nbsp; 
  Medical problems, allergies and side effects, some very serious, have been 
  reported with the use of <b><i>Arnica</i></b> and its interaction with other 
  drugs, herbs and supplements.&nbsp; Please see

  information provided here helps you to be in charge of preventing injuries and
  to take some basic necessary steps to deal with acute symptoms of injuries
  should they occur.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  </span>However, there are times when you may need some professional work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
