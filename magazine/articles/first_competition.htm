        FIRST COMPETITION ABROAD</i></font><font face="Verdana" size="3"> </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">:
        (and an unexpected development)!<br>
        -by Siobhan Mortell<br>
        Salsaweb Cityguide for Ireland<br>
        <a href="mailto:Siobhan@salsaweb.com">Siobhan@salsaweb.com</a>&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It all happened at very short
  notice: In August I decided to go salsa festival in London. Looking up the
  website, a competition was scheduled. A friend in the UK was also going, so we
  decided to enter. There was very little time to prepare and choreograph a 3
  minute piece. All that intensive work and practice. It was very hard work, but
  also great fun. We went to the festival, learned millions of new moves and got
  great tips on all sorts of things.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The competition was on the last
  night of the festival. I went through all my nerves 2 hours ahead, forced a
  dinner down with difficulty, and couldn't bear to watch the couple that danced
  before us in case they were spectacularly wonderful and put me off. But then
  when the time came, I just got out on the floor and strutted my stuff. What a
  thrill! Although we were not the best dancers in the competition (we had
  imagination and variety but needed polishing), we were strong on personality
  and got a really positive audience reaction. What made it for me was not so
  much the prize (we came third), but the great reception we got.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because the competition was a
  heat for a bigger national competition, and only the first and second
  prizewinners in each heat went through, we thought that was that. But then
  there was a surprising development: I got a phone call one Tuesday afternoon
  several weeks later inviting us to the final the following Sunday in London.
  Talk about no advance warning. We hadn't even danced properly together for a
  month, but we took the bull by the horns, and off I went to London. I flew
  over on Saturday midday, and on Saturday night we went out dancing in Salsa
  Palladium - small and intimate, not intimidating, and great fun. Guys
  constantly asked me out to dance, including some really good dancers, and it
  all went really well. My partner and I danced so well (compliments to him for
  making me look good on the dancefloor!) that - guess what, a wonderfully
  stylish dancer (well known in London) asked me out to dance. This guy can be a
  bit elitist about his dance partners; only dancing with amazing dancers, among
  whose ranks I do not (yet!) count myself. So for him to ask me was quite a
  thrill and the dance went fine. My partner was very impressed - he thought it
  looked fantastic. It didn't feel like it did, because I struggled to keep up
  with all sorts of really fast moves that I had never done before in my life.
  But it was fun.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Sunday we checked out of the
  B&amp;B, took all our bags and went to relax in the sun watching the pigeons
  on Trafalgar Square. (how interesting!) We tried to go the portrait gallery
  but couldn't because there was no place to put our bags, and then, after some
  confusion as to which bus to take, we made our way to the competition venue.
  My partner and I spent a lot of time together over the weekend, chatting about
  all sorts of things, deciding where to have breakfast, lunch and dinner, where
  to go out dancing, dragging suitcases around the streets of London, and being
  under lots of pressure with this big competition about to happen. But I was
  only impressed by him - he is very calm, intelligent, interesting, and easy to
  be with. It was a pleasure.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The competition final on Sunday
  night was fun, lots of hype, lots of glamour, being in the changing room with
  all the other couples (80 or so, two couples from each of forty heats all
  around the UK), women and men scurrying around, preening themselves in front
  of the huge mirror, women spraying themselves with body glitter and hairspray,
  guys with cummerbunds, gold and silver dance shoes, debates about who would
  get through, television and video cameras suddenly there and then gone again,
  major adrenalin rush, waiting for your number to be called, etc. Exciting!</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We were up in the third set of
  dancers, ten couples on the floor at a time, two minutes only of freestyle to
  whatever track they played. Thirteen (THIRTEEN!!) adjudicators - oh my god,
  all flitting around the floor taking a good look at you! Our first dance went
  really well, we hoped we'd get through and we did. Lucky for us we got a good
  lively inspiring song, because some of them were slower and a bit blah. It was
  interesting to see what the general standard was like, and it was quite
  obvious from the start who was going to get through to the final rounds. Our
  number was called for the second round but we didn't dance as well this time
  so that was it for us. However, I prefer to view it as representing home among
  the top 40 dancers in the UK! Time to relax and enjoy the rest of the night's
  dancing.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">By the time the semifinal
  (twelve couples I think) came round, the competitors really upped the anti.
  This was where all the cool, dramatic, BIG moves came out of the hat. Some of
  them changed costume. It was quite impressive. They all only got 30 seconds
  freestyle on their own on the dancefloor, then all 12 together, and the same
  procedure for the 6 finalists. The main rule was no lifts or 'aerials', which
  I thought was good. I personally find all that a bit too acrobatic for salsa.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Later in the evening there was a
  demonstration by a Cuban dance troupe. They did a mambo number and a Cuban
  Rumba number, and boy, they really could move - they could have been made of
  rubber as far as I was concerned.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I flew home on Monday 7am for a
  day's work on 45 minutes sleep. (ZZzzzzz!)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was a fabulous experience and
  I would do all again tomorrow (even tonight) if someone gave me the
  opportunity.</font></p>
