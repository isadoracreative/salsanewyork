  long have you been dancing mambo and what got you into it?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  <br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ive been dancing salsa/mambo for
  about seven years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eleanor Lopez,
  a longtime friend, introduced me to the New York salsa scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was those long nights being a wallflower that finally prompted me to
  learn how to dance.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Where did you
  originally learn how to dance mambo and who was (were) your<img border="0" src="../images/rondey_gilbertosantarosa_adc.JPG" align="right" width="216" height="175">
  mentors?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eleanor taught me my first steps,
  while instructors such as <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie</a>
  and <a href="../instructors/maria_torres.htm">Maria Torres</a>, <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
  Flores</a>, and Wilton Beltre were my first classroom teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Ive tried to emulate many of these <a href="../instructors/home.htm">instructors</a>
  in my dancing and teaching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  also consider Teddy Kern, Artistic Director of Dance Manhattan, one of my
  dance mentors.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>How long have you been
  teaching mambo and what made you decide to teach mambo?<br>
  </b>Ive been teaching for a little over five years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I fell into teaching quite by accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I was assisting with a group called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sanando
  through The Arts</i> in the Lower East Side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I got the bug and the rest is history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Ive been at Dance Manhattan for about four years.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
  do you like most about teaching?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seeing a student progress from the
  stage of nervous beginner to competent social dancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>There are fewer things that are more satisfying than that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Its a privilege to be able to contribute to someones
  personal development and dance is an important part of many peoples lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It also reminds me of my learning process.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why
  do you think people come to learn from you?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Id like to think that people enjoy
  my teaching style.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I try my best
  to be as informative and entertaining as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>While I want my students to become good technical dancers, I want them
  to have fun too.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="../images/drc7.jpg" align="left" width="174" height="116">Are
  most of your students men or women? and why is that?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">At one point early on, I had mostly
  women students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I teach many
  more men these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think guys
  have finally realized that one of the best ways to meet women is through
  dance.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  What is the hardest thing you find about teaching?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The hardest thing is coming up with
  the right material for your classes and teaching it in a way that is enjoyable
  and interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its also
  difficult dealing with people who are not at the appropriate class level.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do
  you still like to go to clubs and dance socially?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I still enjoy social dancing at clubs
  and socials, but my <a href="../instructors/rodney_lopez.htm">teaching
  schedule</a> often prevents me from going out as much as Id like.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>How about performing?
  Do you still perform and whom have you performed for or with?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">I enjoy performing tremendously.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ive had the pleasure of performing with several partners
  at numerous social and corporate affairs through Dance Manhattan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Ive also</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="../images/Image3383d2dca1510.jpg" width="395" height="263" align="right"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
  performed extensively with the <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com">Addie-Tude
  Dance Company</a> since joining <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie
  Diazs</a> team this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  also perform quite a bit with Mariana Parma, my Dance Manhattan teaching
  partner and <a href="../instructors/brett_mcnichols.htm">Brett McNichols</a>,
  my 'partner-in-crime' at the <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com">Addie-Tude
  Dance<br>
  Company</a>.&quot;.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Name
  your favorite on stage performance?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I actually have two favorite salsa
  performances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ive had the
  privilege of performing in one of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/photos_muneca_Zurich2002.htm">Addie-Tudes
  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Muñeca</i></a> is one of the most
  creative and technically challenging performances Ive seen in any dance
  style.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a visual spectacle
  that retains its New York salsa street cred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The other is Wilton Beltres <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Soneros
  de Bailadores </i>routine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
  a very musical and exciting piece of choreography, and now that I have the
  privilege of being a member of the 2002 cast of <a href="latin_madness_III_home.htm">Latin
  Madness</a>, I have the opportunity to perform in that number on a regular
  basis - something I've wanted to do for a long time.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
  got you into performing and what was your first time on stage?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Im kind of a ham, so once I
  started dancing it was only a matter of time before I would try to put some of
  the steps on stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My first
  salsa performance was for an international culture celebration at my former
  job in 1996.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eleanor, Negra and I
  danced to Johnnys Mambo from Dirty Dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Nothing is more nerve-wracking than performing in front of your boss
  and colleagues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looking back at
  that choreography is unbearable now.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
  did you feel when you first performed live on stage?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Terror, fright and a little nausea.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Have
  you ever choreographed a routine?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ive had the pleasure of
  choreographing routines for several student performance teams at Dance
  Manhattan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ive also
  choreographed or co-choreographed routines with different dance partners.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
  do you like about being a dance choreographer?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Choreography is a rare opportunity to
  communicate to an audience your own relationship to a piece of music.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What starts with an idea in your head becomes a living,
  breathing expression of performance art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I absolutely love doing it.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="../images/muneca_jimmyanton4.JPG" align="left" width="73" height="144"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
  do you look for in a song when you are putting choreography together for it?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I look for a story, a funky groove,
  and cool breaks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike many
  routines that Ive seen, I dont believe that speed is the most important
  thing in a dance routine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nobody
  cares if you can do a million moves a minute; I believe people appreciate a
  performance that is musical.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Have
  you traveled to teach workshops and seminars? If so where have you gone?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">To date, all of my dance workshops
  have been in the New York tri-state area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Id like to teach in some other areas at some point.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What is the difference
  between teaching a regular class and special one-shot workshop/seminar?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">A one-time seminar requires a
  different kind of preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
  youve only got your students for one or two hours, you want to make sure
  they leave feeling theyve learned something specific  something they can
  apply to their dancing immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  a <a href="../instructors/rodney_lopez.htm">weekly class</a>, if you dont
  get something this week, you can always review it next class.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Which gives you the
  best joy? Teaching, performing or putting together choreography?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although choreography is fun, it
  isnt always easy to come up with fresh ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Teaching is probably most enjoyable since I see results of some sort
  every week.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
  is it that you prepare yourself for a workshop? and for a performance?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I prepare for a workshop by thinking
  about my students and their level of dance and trying my best to teach
  appropriate material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I prepare
  for a performance by rehearsing as much as I can and remembering that its
  important to have a good time on stage.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What advice would you
  give those just getting into mambo? How can they work at</b></font><img border="0" src="../images/muneca_msd1.JPG" align="right" width="178" height="216"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
  getting better at dancing?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Have fun with the dance, meet and
  dance with as many people as possible and LISTEN TO THE MUSIC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Theres no dance without music so its important to be as
  knowledgeable as you can.<br>
  <br>
  </font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
  best could you describe your way of dancing? of teaching? and of performing?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">My dancing is kind of goofy
  funky  I dont take myself too seriously so I just dance and try to
  have the best time I can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I do
  take my teaching seriously and think I have a thoughtful and technical
  teaching style.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I like to explain as much as I can, since thats the way I
  like to learn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I try to dance as
  naturally as I can when performing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>How is New York Mambo
  dancing different from mambo dancing in other parts of the country?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">New York salsa/mambo dancers have an
  almost religious preference for breaking on two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But whats great is that you can find all kinds of salsa dancing in
  New York because of its </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> history in this city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Theres a place to go dancing every night.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana" size="5"><img border="0" src="../images/rodneylopez_hs2a.JPG" align="left" width="166" height="206"></font></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do
  you think that dancers get treated with respect? If not why?<br>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think dancers are getting more of
  the respect they deserve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Especially
  since social </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> dancing has re-emerged as an important leisure activity, dancers
  and <a href="../instructors/home.htm">dance teachers</a> are getting more
  props.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What would you like to
  see happen to mambo within the next few years?, next decade? within your
  lifetime?<br>
  </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Id like to see mambo continue to
  be exported across the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Id
  also like to see a salsa museum in East Harlem or the South Bronx to honor all
  of the great musicians and dancers that have contributed to this art form.</font></p>
