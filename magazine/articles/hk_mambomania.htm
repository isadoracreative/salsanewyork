It takes &quot;2&quot; to Mambo.&nbsp;
</font>
</b> <font size="2" face="Verdana">
 Since the summer there has not
only been a marked<br>
improvement in the level of Salsa dancing in Hong Kong, but a major shift in<br>
the way we dance too.&nbsp; In a nutshell, Mambo has entered the local dance<br>
vocabulary and more and more people are combining Salsa with a Mambo<br>
'twist'.&nbsp; This is largely due to the arrival of <b><a href="../instructors/winsome_lee.htm">Winsome Lee</a> </b>and her
success<br>
in encouraging everyone to try dancing on &quot;2&quot;.&nbsp; If you observe
the dancers<br>
in any of the clubs in Hong Kong, it is now obvious that people feel a lot<br>
more comfortable dancing independently of their partner and practicing their<br>
fancy footwork (Shines).<br>
<br>
They are also more comfortable dancing to straight Mambo music, which<br>
(shock/horror) has more in common with Jazz than pop!&nbsp; This is a big deal,<br>
as the music produced by people like Tito Puente, Benny Mor√© and Mongo<br>
Santamaria is THE original dance music.&nbsp; It's therefore great to see people<br>
here finally appreciating this and dancing to it naturally.&nbsp; This was not<br>
the case six months ago.<br>
<br>
Back in June, I remember playing Tito Puente's Ran Kan Kan at one Salsa<br>
party and watching everyone leave the floor.&nbsp; Today, the same track has the<br>
opposite effect.&nbsp; So, what's changed?&nbsp; Well, for one thing, even if
people<br>
still feel more comfortable dancing on the &quot;1&quot;, they at least know
what the<br>
&quot;2&quot; is.&nbsp; Winsome has done a fine job in initiating us and
encouraging us to<br>
experiment on &quot;2&quot; - hopefully, this is something that will continue.&nbsp;
There<br>
are now lots of couples who continue Salsa on &quot;1&quot; with Mambo shines.<br>
<br>
What is equally important though is that people seem to have a less<br>
restricted view of the music, and now feel almost as comfortable dancing to<br>
Tito Puente as they do to Victor Manuel.&nbsp; As I said before, this is quite a<br>
big deal for Hong Kong Salseros as not long ago they couldn't dance to<br>
anything that didn't have the words 'Mi Corazon' repeated 1000 times.&nbsp; It<br>
marks a huge shift in the type of music that is seen as 'danceable' and<br>
allow DJs to play Mambo tracks they would never have dared play previously.&nbsp;<br>
Many traditional Cuban musicians claim they don't understand the term<br>
'Salsa' at all, since they haven't changed the music they've always played,<br>
and the music they've always played has been called Mambo.<br>
<br>
Mambo has some great shine steps, which you can also do when dancing to that<br>
Victor Manuel track, and one of the nice things about Salsa in Hong Kong, is<br>
watching people mix-it-up naturally on the dance floor.&nbsp; Maybe this is the<br>
best compromise after all.&nbsp; Though Mambo originated in Cuba, a lot of the<br>
new generation of Club dancers in the States and other countries don't<br>
really know how to dance to it.&nbsp; Instead, they have taken Salsa on
&quot;1&quot; to an<br>
exciting level and developed fantastic styles and great moves.<br>
<br>
But are they missing something?&nbsp; If they haven't tried dancing on
&quot;2&quot;, then<br>
probably the answer is yes.&nbsp; As most of us now realize, on &quot;2&quot;,
you hear the<br>
music differently, move differently, and ultimately dance differently.&nbsp; As<br>
Winsome has explained many times, the &quot;2&quot; opens up all kinds of<br>
possibilities which may not come that easily on the &quot;1&quot;.&nbsp; So all
things<br>
considered, I think we've made a lot of progress in the last 6 months, not<br>
only have we got to know the &quot;2&quot;, we are finally listening to the
really<br>
great Salsa musicians, and having a good laugh at people who think that<br>
Ricky Martin has got anything to do with 'Salsa'.
