    you ever wondered what the salsa scene would be like once you are at the
    retirement age?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are in
    your 20s or 30s, most congresses that we attend today will be
    reuniting dancers for the 40th or so anniversary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Will we all be there?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will
    your passion for the dance be the same as when you were a young adult?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Will we all be circled around each other admiring the retired couple
    battling each other on the dance floor?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>How different was the scene then as it is now?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Well, in December 2001, I discovered some pretty interesting things
    that the new comer of today has to look forward to tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span><o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Verdana">I recently had the
    pleasure of performing at the wonderful, and luxurious Goldcoast Ballroom in
    Coconut Creek, Florida.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Home to
    the retired, but hospitable to all that grace their dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm">Candy</a> and I were
    well received there and after we socially danced, many of the regulars came
    over to congratulate us on a job well done as they enlightened us of the
    many dance stories they experienced at places that no longer exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>One after another they came over to give us a taste of the mambo past
    and the vision of whats to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    wasnt until one of the ladies there took me by my wrist and walked me on
    the other side of the 3000 square foot ballroom, and put me face to face
    with a lady named Bea, who danced at places like the Palladium, that I
    realized I was about to be enlightened.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Verdana">I never asked to
    dance with Bea and it sure didnt look like she asked or even wanted to
    dance with me at first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither
    one of us knew each other but this lady that took me by the wrist swore that
    Bea moved similarly to Candy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    lady took both Bea and myself and positioned us on the dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>We looked at each other without even knowing who the other one was,
    and to save face both Bea and I danced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Right from the start I knew something was about to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>I gave Bea a CBL (editor's note: Cross Body Lead) and 25 people or so
    stood up and walked over to where Bea and I were dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I gave Bea a single right turn and 6 or 7 couples stopped
    dancing and turned </span><span style="font-family:Verdana">around to watch
    us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I gave her a double and the
    crowed gasped and then I knew it was on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Our confusion of each other turned to wonder as I did a double right
    turn and she screamed out Woh!!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    crowd cheered<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So I figured if the crowd wants a show then a show is what
    the crowd will get and Bea got to work on them too.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Turn pattern after turn pattern we danced as sweat was
    forming from us both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt
    the need to do shines as the song was nearing the end so I could see what
    she had to offer the eagerly anticipating crowd as well as myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>I started off with something s</span><span style="font-family:Verdana">imple
    like a Suzy Q chord to see if she could hang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>She jumped straight back on</span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a href="../instructors/jai_candy.htm"><img border="0" src="../home_news_images/jai_candy_perform.jpg" align="right" width="266" height="226"></a></b></font><span style="font-family:Verdana">
    the heels of her shoes and stayed suspended in the bar of the music and
    screamed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of her male
    friends yelled out<b> go easy on him Bea.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>So I did one of my more advanced steps called on the edge which
    ends with four circular chest rolls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bea
    approved but at the same time she syncopated her way to where I was waiting
    as she did a double body roll.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    was hips, stomach, ribs, chest, shoulders, head and then she went back down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Head, shoulders, chest, ribs, stomach, hips and boom the song</span><span style="font-family:Verdana">
    was over<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    dip, a hug, and then a kiss as we parted ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The crowd congratulated us both and I went back to thank the lady who
    took me to Bea but she had disappeared into the mix of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>I never got a chance to speak to Bea or the lady who brought me to
    her after my dance down mambo lane, but I no longer wonder where I will be,
    or what I will be doing if God keeps me around another 40 or 50 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>I cant help but feel that the scene that I know today is not as
    different, but rather more similar than I could ever imagine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Sure the dance has changed a bit, the turn patterns are faster and
    more complicated, the shines are more syncopated and complex, the music is
    more technologically defined, they sold it as mambo we sell it as salsa, the
    people have come and gone but the essence of everyones passion and desire
    to be part of the dance, no matter how big or small, is exactly the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess you can say Bea schooled me that day but the ironic
    thing is that her invaluable lesson never said a word</span></p>
