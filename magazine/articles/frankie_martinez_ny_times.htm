<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">Forget About the Hair:<br>
<u>Time for Mambo Salon<br>
</u>On Sundays, East Village Stylist<br>
Stops Curling and Starts Swinging</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By Lynda Richardson</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By Sunday afternoon, the ringlets of cut hair
and traces of ponytails are swept up at the Ene Hair Salon in the East Village.
The swivel chairs and the bubble hair dryer are tucked in a corner. But jars of
aqua-blue Barbicide, hairspray and pomade still line the counters as men and
women sway forward and back across the winered plywood floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the week, many go to the salon for
trims, highlights, conditioning treatments, maybe an upper body massage. But
come Sunday afternoon, they are infected by mambo madness when the
basement-level salon on East Ninth Street turns into a dance palace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their hips are rotating. Their arms coil upward
as they twirl. Some count out the beat for the syncopated steps under their
breath as they plunge into a dip, then a spin</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All the while, the salon proprietors
Pekingese poodle terrier Virginia (nicknamed Peekapoo), weaves between the legs
of mambo dancers, barking appreciatively at the Afro-Cuban melodies that float
out onto the sidewalk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is easy to become indifferent to the
oddities of the East Village, a neighborhood where pierced noses and spiky dyed
hair are common and boutiques with names like Religious Sex sell leather
corsets. This is New York, after all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet there is something particularly off-kitter,
like a campy John Walters film. To the mambo scene at the Ene Hair Salon on
Sundays.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even as the Chorus lines on more than a dozen
people heat up the floor, elbow to elbow, a few frazzled people amble in, eager
to make appointments for haircuts and colorings, And on a recent Sunday, an
aggressive salesman blustered through the door, insisting on giving his sales
pitch for an electronics product to the salon owner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Dont you see were dancing,
man,&quot; said the annoyed proprietor, Nelson Barreto, who was trying to
maneuver a mambo turn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I came a long way,&quot; huffed the
indignant salesman, glaring over his shoulder on his way out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More often than not, though, passers-by find
themselves stopping in their tracks on the sidewalk, peering inside the bay
window of the Ene Salon. The place is hard to miss. Its lavender-painted facade
has a window graced with a two-foot-high statue of a praying angel, with a
container of hair gel stuck between ots wings.(The salon gets its name, Ene,
from the Spanish pronounciation of the letter n (EN-eh), the initial of the
owners first name.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mambo tradition, if it can be called one
yet, began about two months ago when Mr. Barreto agreed to let the dance
instructor boyfriend of one of his hairstylists hold classes there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We wanted to do something else we hadnt
done before,&quot; said Mr. Barreto, a 35-year-old native of Puerto Rico. He
lives in a fifth-floor walk-up next door. &quot;Were given license to make
you feel beautiful and music is an addition to that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Classes began with a handful of clients on the
salons mailing list, but the mambo sessions have grown exponentially as
clients have told their friends. Like the homey salon, which resembles an
eccentric aunts living room with its glided mirrors, vintage furniture and
bric-a-brac, the $15 classes draw a multicultural crowd, all tantalized by Latin
rhythms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is not quite the Palladium in Midtown
Manhattan, the legendary Latin ballroom that was ground zero for the mambo in
the 1950's when it was the most popular dance craze in the Western world. But
the salon has created its own special comfort zone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;People feel like they know us,&quot; Mr.
Barreto said. &quot;Its less threatening than going to a club or a huge
class, where people know how to dance. Some dont want people to know they
have two left feet.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Laura Nuss-Caneda, a 37-year-pld public school
teacher from Brooklyn, has her long reddish-brown hair colored at the salon. But
on Sundays, she is accompanied by her Mexican-born husband, Rene, a
Spanish-language tutor. She appreciates the diversity of the salon as much as
learning the mambo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You have to work hard to find communities
that are different,&quot; she said. This is a way that we can do that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other Sunday, it was getting steamy inside
the salon so the door was left open to let in cool air. The customers were
learning a beginners step, the right foot crossing over the keft foot as hips
twist and swivel on three beats. The instructor, <b><a href="../instructors/frankie_martinez.htm">Frankie Martinez</a></b>, calls
it the &quot;Suzy-Q,&quot; because the step feels the way it sounds as the hips
twist, twist, twist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. Martinez, a trimly built 24-year-old with a
goatee, learned the mambo from his mentor, <b><a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a></b>, a leading New
York mambo teacher who has a professional dance troupe. Mr. Martinez is a
member. The mambo is the original version of the popular dance called the salsa,
but it is danced on a different time structure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is evident in the salon that some customers
will never advance to what might be called the mambos black belt, an
intricate pattern of quick steps that is sort of skating with the feet. Mr.
Torres calls it the &quot;syncopated jelly jam, a little dab will do you.&quot;
(Dont even ask!)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Stylist trades curling for full body
twirling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the instructor, who was dressed the other
day in a billowy white shirt, cream-colored pants and black and white dance
shoes, remained consistently upbeat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You mambo divas, you,&quot; Mr. Martinez
called out, his dimples deepening as the dancers laughed. They snapped their
fingers to find the driving beat when the instructor turned on the tape player.
And as the two hour session melted away, they stopped glancing at their feet so
much, undulating confidently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the salons most loyal customers is
Toni Castillo, a petite 51-year-old who gets golden highlights on her textured
bob. Now, the Queens resident is also a regular on Sunnday, hauling in her
grim-faced boyfriend, Carlos Flores. He was stuck the other day on a move with
his back facing Ms. Castillo, Mr. Flores had to drop his partners hand down
his back and lightly catch it with the opposite hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ms. Catillo, wearing jeans and black stiletto
heels, giggled that her 45-year-old boyfriend told her that she should get a leg
transplant to improve her moves. She does not mind that he pokes fun at her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We come in every single Sunday,&quot; she
said merrily. &quot;Its been beautiful.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As dusk fell on a recent Sunday, the mambo
instructors girlfriend, Aisha Koswara, sat quietly next to a row of deep
sinks for shampooing. She was engrossed, listening to a woman who had wandered
in off the street. The woman, Ann Schwanke, owns a lingerie import business abd
spoke to Ms. Koswara about feeling a bit psychic. Not even five minutes before,
she said she was thinking about Latin dance lessons - then there was the mambo
class.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I saw something going on in the hair
salon that was not hair,&quot; said Ms. Schwanke, who began displaying silken
lingerie from a bag to Ms. Koswara in hopes of collaborating on a lingerie mambo
party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On occasion,<b> Ms. Koswara</b>, a svelte
22-year-old with a pierced diamond stud in her nose, joined her boyfriend, Mr.
Martinez, on the dance floor to give a dazzling demostration of the tricky step.
The class watched the couples liquid moves in silence before bursting in
applause.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was the hairstylists idea to have mambo
classes at the salon. She saw nothing unusual in it. She noted how her Puerto
Rican mother met her father, newly arrived in New York from Indoesia, in an
underground gambling den in the neighborhood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Everything happens in the Village,&quot;
she said with a nonchalant shrug.</font></p>
