    the New York Mambo Scene for some time. <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy
    Anton's</a> <b><font color="#FF0000"><a href="jimmy_anton_social.htm">Latin Sunday Social</a></font></b>
    has been the most successful and longest running of these events (held the 1st &amp; 3rd
    Sunday of every month at the Dance Manhattan Dance Studio); followed closely by <a
    href="../instructors/bernard_martinez.htm">Bernard Martinez's</a> Mambo Caliente Social
    Dance. But the success of <a href="jimmy_anton_social.htm">Jimmy Anton's Social Dance</a>,
    <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille Thomas&#146;s</a> Seasonal Social
    Dance and Bernard Martinez's Mambo Caliente Social Dance have sparked others to do the
    same. The most recent to join the trend is <a href="../instructors/thomas_guerrero.htm">Thomas
    Guerrero</a> with his <a href="../../calendar.htm">Santo Rico Social dance</a>. For some
    instructors, its an opportunity to help their newer students get their &quot;feet
    wet&quot; in a dancing environment. These instructors realize (perhaps from
    self-experience) that new students may be too shy to strut their stuff at local mambo
    clubs. So the social dance scene is a relatively simple way of giving them the experience
    and courage to go out there on their own. For others, it may an opportunity to help
    promote their school among the local NY mambo dance community. Most of the original Social
    Dances I know of started on Sundays, but many of the newer ones like <a
    href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille's</a> seasonal event (Winter, Fall,
    Spring, Summer) and <a href="../../calendar.htm">Bernard Martinez's Mambo Caliente</a>
    currently target a Saturday night crowd (thus offering them an alternative to Dance Club
    scene).&nbsp;</font></p>

        Jimmy is the DJ and knows which tunes to pick to get the place kicking. This is my
        personal favorite of all Social Dances. The<strong> B.Y.O.P </strong>(bring your own

    Besides dancing Salsa/Mambo at local dance clubs (like the <a href="../../calendar.htm">Copacabana
    &amp; Latin Quaters</a>), there are a series of dance activities held throughout the New
    York City area call Social Dances. Social Dances are the perfect alternative for those
    looking to go out mambo dancing but wish to avoid the local club scene. With Social Dances
    you avoid the smoke filled, over crowded pick-up atmosphere associated with dance clubs.
    You get the space to dance in and you hang with other people who just want to do the same
    thing you do:<b> DANCE</b>.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>

    happy <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille Thomas</a> has made his seasonal
    social dance an on-going event</font></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These social events held each week gather mambo students
    and their friends for a couple of hours of <i><u>fun, practice and mingling</u></i>.
    What&#146;s cool about them is that you can come as you please (I normally like to wear
    sweats &amp; sneakers cause I go to dance my butt off), practice whatever new turns
    you&#146;ve recently learned on some poor unsuspecting partner and possibly pick up some
    turns in return. The sense of pressure to do well which sometimes is associated with clubs
    is not present here. You are there to dance, plain and simple.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the most part everyone ends up dancing with almost
    everyone there. And if you are a good dancer....<b><u>watch out!!!!!</u></b>, cause people
    will be lining up to dance with you. By the way fellas, girls are very aggressive in NY.
    If they think you are a good dancer, they&#146;ll just come right up to you and ask you
    for the next dance. What&#146;s great about these events is that it gives you a chance to
    meet others who like you love to mambo. You get to network, find out which spots are hot
    and which are not. Bottom line the more people you meet, the less hassle you&#146;ll have
    finding people to dance with at clubs cause you&#146;re bound to know someone you can
    break the ice and dance with.</font></p>

    Take on the NY Social Dance Scene</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
    A New York Perspective</a>, </font></strong><font face="Verdana" size="1">by <a

    Social Dances are great events to go to and its a definite plus that they are liquor and
    smoke free. The people I know that go to them to dance, mingle and have fun. I've seen
    dancers of various levels come to dance, practice, perfect and experiment their mambo
    skills. At the Social Dances I go to, everyone usually ends up dancing with everyone
    there. If you're a good dancer watch out, because your dance card will get filled very
    quickly (which is o.k. by me - cause I love to dance).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Social dances are a great place to work out the kinks in
    your new turn patterns. You can practice and practice and practice and not care how many
    times you screw up because people are not there to show off, but to HAVE FUN. The key word
    here people is fun. Let me say that again, the key word to remember when it comes to
    social dances folks is FUN!!!!!!! If you're not having it, then chances are its not a very
    good social dance. There should be no sense of pressure or tension. You just go there, let
    yourself go, dance, enjoy yourself and have fun (plain and simple). And if you're really
    lucky you can pick up a turn pattern or two and even get to practice them on some poor
    unsuspecting victim ( ... I mean partner). (all in good fun).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The dress code at social dances is another plus (there
    isn't any). People go there in anything from sweats and sneakers to slacks and shirts. I
    myself favor the sweat pants, t-shirt and sneaker attire. To me its like doing an aerobic
    workout so I dress the part (not to mention that I bring along several dry t-shirts to
    change into and a towel to stay dry). I find that my partners like me better when I'm not
    damp with my own sweat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like I said earlier, Social Dances are a great place to
    mingle and meet other die hard salseros like yourself. You can get to network with others
    who share the same love in dancing and in music. Find out what places are hot and which
    bands are playing where.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well I hope that this page has watered your mambo taste
    buds enough to check out the Social Dance Scene. Look forward to sharing the dance floor
    with you real soon. - Sincerely, Manny</font></p>
