  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like the rest
  of the world I found myself glued to the TV on <b>Tuesday, September 11, 2001</b>
  watching the horror of the World Trade Center as it unfolded. At the time of
  this disaster I was in Puerto Rico visiting my mother. Like the rest of the
  world, I lost all phone contact with my New York family and friends. As I
  tried frantically to get a hold of them, the rest of the Salsa World was
  trying to do the same thing. Phone lines were down &amp; cell phones were out.
  Email was the only means of communication left to me and the rest of the Salsa
  world. I began getting email messages from fellow salseros asking for the well
  being and whereabouts of other salseros. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those of us
  who live in New York know that NY Mambo Instructor <a href="../instructors/delille_thomas.htm">Delille
  Thomas</a> works during the day in the World Trade Center. <a href="../instructors/mario_diaz.htm">Mario
  Diaz</a> as well as others began inquiring about his whereabouts. Soon there
  was a rapid fire of email messages from salseros combining their resources.
  After several hours, Delille responded. In this case there was a happy ending.
  But with roughly 5,000 people missing in the aftermath, this cannot always be
  the case. The News and the Government has said several times that by the time
  this is over, everyone in NY will either know someone who has perished in the
  attack or knows of someone who knows someone who was killed in the attack. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">I
  myself have been informed that a fellow stuntman who works as a NYC fireman
  was one of the first into the World Trade Center and is listed as missing when
  the buildings came crashing down.<o:p>

  Pray for the medical staffs at hospitals and other medical facialities trying

  that our countrymen and women will not take their frustrations out on others,
  who had nothing to do with the terrorist acts, other than they maybe of the

  <br>
  Never have I been so deeply moved by an event, it has literally shaken me to<br>
  the core.&nbsp; Below is a poem that has worked its way out of my weeping
  soul.<br>
  Alma<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Death of The Twins<br>
  <br>
  Under the helmet of a perfect and boundless sky,<br>
  She watched as a rocket hurled into the heart of her Northern sister.<br>
  <br>
  Racked with pain as the heat soared from her heart,<br>
  She watched a rocket tear into the belly of her Southern sister.<br>
  <br>
  Aching and agonizing, the twins leaned into each other,<br>
  Bidding each other a final farewell.<br>
  <br>
  Her heart wrenching, she watched as her Southern sister fell to the ground,<br>
  Watching and waiting until the pain was too great<br>
  And then she too, crumbled to the ground.<br>
  <br>
  And just like that...<br>
  <br>
  Thousands of dreams,<br>
  Thousands of hopes,<br>
  Went up in smoke.<br>
  <br>
  Thousands of mothers and fathers,<br>
  Thousands of brothers and sisters,<br>
  Thousands of friends and lovers,<br>
  All were buried in the rubble.<br>
  <br>
  And the world wept,<br>
  For the death of the twins was too great to bear.<br>
  <br>
  And in the aftermath,<br>
  The anger begins to brew.</font></p>
