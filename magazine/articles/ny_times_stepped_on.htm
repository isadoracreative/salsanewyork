        Shanley and Humberto Lopez met in a nightclub with starfish on the walls
        and a pulsing Latin beat in the air. They caught each other's eye
        immediately -- she of the long blond hair, white pants and rabbit fur
        top; he of the orange shirt and handsome dark looks.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A song was starting and he asked her to
        dance. She said yes and they locked bodies in the semidarkness.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then they bumped knees. Then they
        pulled in different directions. Then the song became interminable. When
        it was over, they hung out together but did not dance again.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It was a total mess,&quot; said
        Mr. Lopez, 23, a waiter from Queens.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It was kind of a disaster,&quot;
        agreed Ms. Shanley, 44, an advertising sales representative who is also
        from Queens.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ms. Shanley was dancing &quot;on
        2,&quot; known as New York-style mambo, in which the first long step,
        known as the break step, comes on the second beat and there are no
        pauses.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Lopez was dancing &quot;on 1,&quot;
        the style favored by many mambo dancers in which the first long step
        comes on the first beat, and the dancers pause on the fourth and the
        eighth beats.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The encounter occurred two months ago
        in Miami, but it could have taken place on any dance floor in any Latin
        club these days. Call it the mambo wars.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dancers on the 1 beat say they follow
        the melody, dancers on the 2, the percussion.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;When you are that one beat off,
        you're not in sync,&quot; said Ms. Shanley, who has since taught Mr.
        Lopez &quot;on 2.&quot; &quot;I try to just follow, but when that
        happens, you try to get the guy to come to your timing. But if he can't,
        you have to stay wherever he is.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going out dancing did not used to be
        such a struggle.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But salsa dancing, as mambo is often
        known today, is hotter than ever, surpassing even the craze of the
        1950's. Cultural historians attribute the resurgent popularity in part
        to globalization and the Internet. With the wider appeal has come a new
        zeal to dance well.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In New York, dance studios report
        record enrollment in salsa classes, higher than that for tango or swing
        in major studios like DanceSport in Manhattan. And many more instructors
        than before are teaching the &quot;on 2,&quot; the style that old-timers
        recall as a favorite during the heyday of the Palladium in the 1950's
        and of the Mambo King himself, Tito Puente, who died on May 31.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the advent of salsa Web sites,
        international dance performance tours and even an annual world salsa
        congress in Puerto Rico, the style has been spreading to cities like Los
        Angeles and Chicago and abroad, to countries like Italy and Japan.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as the 2's run into the 1's, a
        night out can turn into a pressure cooker. In many Latin clubs in New
        York, the dancers -- white, black, Asian, Hispanic -- come from many
        different cultures, but they are grouped not by ethnicity, but by beat.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;People go to clubs to get rid of
        stress, but now there's more stress on the dance floor than at
        work,&quot; said Eddie Torres, a longtime New York mambo instructor who
        is widely recognized as a master of &quot;on 2.&quot; &quot;You go to
        clubs and it's like the Olympics of salsa. It's not a healthy
        competition. There are girls who tell me that a partner would try to
        give them a class in the middle of the dance floor.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pedro Reyes, 26, an electronics
        technician, was clinging to his fellow 1's on a recent Wednesday night
        on the first floor of Nell's, on West 14th Street near Eighth Avenue in
        Manhattan, which has Cuban Soul nights once a week. The &quot;on 2&quot;
        aficionados were in the basement.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once, Mr. Reyes said, he ventured into
        &quot;on 2&quot; territory only to be told by a woman that he did not
        know how to dance. &quot;It's just the opposite,&quot; he said. &quot;I
        can't dance like that. They're from the dance studios. It's more
        cabaret, more show.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The upside is that there is a good deal
        of great dancing going on in many places. At clubs like the Latin
        Quarter on the Upper West Side and the Copacabana in Midtown, &quot;on
        2&quot; dancers are easy to spot: their style is skillful and flashy,
        with men spinning women like tops and partners separating every now and
        then to show off fancy footwork known as &quot;shines.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But some couples look like clones of
        one another. And many &quot;on 2&quot; dancers will not dance with just
        anyone. In this subculture, dancers often take classes every week. They
        hold socials where no alcohol is served. They even have their own Web
        site, SalsaNewYork.com, which lists dance events and includes &quot;on
        2&quot; dancers in an e-mail list &quot;as long as this is their
        preferred and dominant way of dancing to salsa.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ben Rapoport, 34, Web master of
        Salsaweb.com, a popular salsa site, knows and appreciates both styles,
        but he said he understood why the &quot;on 2&quot; dancers wanted to
        stick together. &quot;As soon as you start learning moves, dancing
        becomes another world,&quot; he explained. &quot;It becomes much more
        athletic, more exciting, and you want to do that with people who dance
        at your level.&quot; Good looks are no longer enough to entice a man
        across the dance floor.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At a club once, Mr. Rapoport said, he
        had to vouch for a girlfriend's competence as an &quot;on 2&quot; before
        one of his friends would dance with her, &quot;and she was very
        attractive!&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Despite the competition, there are
        mambo conciliators who say &quot;on 1&quot; and &quot;on 2&quot; are
        like vanilla and chocolate ice cream, both delicious.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, of course, dancers, can dance both
        styles. But &quot;on 1&quot; dancers who learn to dance &quot;on 2&quot;
        usually become converts. Many say they find &quot;on 2&quot; more
        engaging, more challenging. Some call it more authentic.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To dance on 2 is really going
        back to Africa because it's dancing to the drums,&quot; said Neyda
        Martinez, 36, a publicist and arts consultant. &quot;To me, on the 1 is
        for only listening to the top layer of the music. It's more melodic. But
        the dancing on the 2 is really on the African beat.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But &quot;on 1&quot; dancers say they
        are just as hooked.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The music on the 1 is very strong
        for me. You feel it more,&quot; said Luis Vazquez, 28, a dance
        instructor in Los Angeles, who travels internationally with his
        five-year-old performing group, Salsa Brava.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is also less contrived, he
        contended. &quot;Nobody can really hear the 2; somebody has to teach you
        to listen to the percussion. On 1 you just hear the music, like when you
        clap, you start clapping on the 1.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Torres, having lived through the
        1970's, when dancers abandoned salsa for the hustle in droves, finds the
        new interest in salsa gratifying. Mr. Torres and his wife and dance
        partner, Maria, now teach about 600 students each week at their studios
        in Midtown and the Bronx, six times as many as a decade ago.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Torres said that the main
        difference between the two styles is that &quot;on 1&quot; dancing has a
        pause in the 4/4 time structure of the basic salsa step that is absent
        when dancing on the 2. &quot;Tito Puente didn't recognize 'on 1' for the
        mambo,&quot; Mr. Torres, 50, said. &quot;He used to say, 'Who has seen
        music pause? The body shouldn't stop.' &quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Torres, a New Yorker of Puerto
        Rican descent, said he &quot;naturally fell on the 2&quot; when he
        started dancing as a young boy, and for years he danced without paying
        attention to breaking down the steps, just as many Latinos do.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I'd be asked, do you dance on
        2?&quot; he recalled. &quot;And I'd say, 'On two feet?' &quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, in 1977, a friend who taught
        ballroom dancing asked him to put a count to the &quot;street&quot;
        version of the 2 that he grew up with, the New York-style mambo, which
        is different from another &quot;on 2&quot; style that had been taught in
        ballroom classes.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But Mr. Torres regrets that that
        technique has come at the expense of some spontaneity. &quot;The more
        technique, the more you leave the jungle,&quot; he said. &quot;I used to
        do crazy things while dancing, and I'd ask myself, 'What got into me?'
        &quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But for the salsa dancers who are
        trying to cope with the different styles, it<i> is </i>a jungle out
        there.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At Nell's last week, Arthur Rutledge,
        who prefers the 2, was left to do some steps on his own from the
        sidelines downstairs after being turned down by a woman.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I asked a lady to dance and she
        said no, and I don't know if it's because she doesn't know how to dance
        or because she has a different style,&quot; said Mr. Rutledge, 25, a
        model.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leonardo Wignall, 60, a regular at
        Nell's and a Cuban who immigrated in 1980, said the Afro-Cuban rhythms
        from which salsa derives have too many elements to dance them any one
        way.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;If you listen to the orchestra,
        it tells you what to dance,&quot; he said.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But most dancers do not listen, he
        said. &quot;The rhythm changes and they keep dancing the same way.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet others say that many of today's
        dancers are missing the point. Whatever happened to trying to adjust to
        each other's rhythm, to men who strove to make the women feel good?
        asked Paul Pellicoro, owner of DanceSport, near Lincoln Center.</font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The object is to make your
        partner feel in heaven,&quot; he said. &quot;Ask the old-timers.&quot;</font></p>
