    is the first time to my knowledge that someone has ever made an attempt of tackling this
    topic. Charles should be commended for rising to the task. SalsaNewYork would love for
    others to write more about on how to choose and break down a song for a performance.&nbsp; 
    Also, see our list of <a href="../../guide/song_list.htm#SONGS">Good Salsa 
    Dance Songs</a>, and also our section on how to make and care for a CD with 
    a performance song so that it doesn't skip or stop during a performance.&nbsp;

    </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1">-by Charles Joseph Smith (&quot;The Little Lily

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Being a salsa dance fanatic for 5 years was
    exciting enough, but being in a salsa dance performance was even more exciting. I had
    already danced in (and choreographed) two salsa songs for my partner, Jessica Pupovac for
    a talent show called &quot;No Acts Barred in 1998 and 1999 at the University of Illinois
    at Urbana. Seeing the movie &quot;Dance With Me&quot; inspired me to get into the world of
    salsa dance choreography.<br>
    <br>
    So you and your partner want to do a salsa performance? Good. And do you know a good
    repertoire of salsa moves from beginner-level to advanced to make the dance so exciting
    that it will persuade would-be salsa dancers to sign up and <a
    href="../instructors/home.htm">take salsa dance lessons</a> from you or to <a
    href="../../calendar.htm">see future salsa performances?</a>&nbsp; But how can you do a
    salsa performance to the music if you don't know how the salsa song you are going to
    perform to is made up of.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I had heard a lot of salsa songs (including old-time mambos such as &quot;Ran Kan
    Kan&quot;, &quot;De Todo Un Poco&quot;, and &quot;Descarga Criolla&quot;) and began to
    adore over 50 of them. However, since there are thousands of salsa songs today, salsa song
    structures can be almost numerous; so I only will show you how several salsas songs are
    made up (listed below). But one thing is common--salsas will<br>
    have a verse or verses, choruses that will have a call-and-response (that is, the lead
    singer utters out the call and the background singers do the response to the lead singer's
    call, or vice-versa), and instrumental breaks and/or bridges.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Structure no. 1<br>
    </b>Example: &quot;No me acostumbro&quot; (Rey Ruiz)<br>
    1. The verse (after a short introduction)<br>
    2. The chorus<br>
    3. The second verse<br>
    4. The chorus<br>
    5. The instrumental break or bridge<br>
    6. The chorus reprise with call-and-response<br>
    7. Another instrumental break or bridge<br>
    8. Another chorus reprise with call-and-response<br>
    9. The ending<br>
    <br>
    <b>Structure no. 2<br>
    </b>Example: &quot;Juliana&quot; (DLG)<br>
    1. The chorus with call-and-response<br>
    2. The first verse<br>
    3. The chorus with call-and-response<br>
    4. The second verse<br>
    5. The chorus with call-and-response<br>
    6. Third (and subsequent verses)<br>
    7. The chorus with call-and-response<br>
    8. Instrumental break<br>
    9. The chorus with call-and-response with some change in words<br>
    10.Another instrumental break<br>
    11.Reprise of chorus with call-and-response as in no. 9<br>
    12.Ending with pattern almost similar to no. 1 and/or no. 10<br>
    <br>
    <b>Structure no. 3<br>
    </b>Example: Lloraras (Oscar D'Leon)<br>
    1. Instrumental introduction<br>
    2. First verse<br>
    3. Instrumental break<br>
    4. Second verse<br>
    5. Another instrumental break<br>
    6. Third verse<br>
    7. Instrumental bridge<br>
    8. Chorus with call-and-response<br>
    9. Ending<br>
    <br>
    <b>Structure no. 4<br>
    </b>Example: &quot; Pedro Navaja&quot; (Ruben Blades)<br>
    1. Instrumental introduction<br>
    2. A set of several verses without instrumental breaks<br>
    3. Short chorus<br>
    4. Chorus with call-and-response<br>
    5. Instrumental break and vocal bridge<br>
    6. Chorus reprise with call-and-response<br>
    7. Another instrumental break and vocal bridge<br>
    8. Chorus reprise with call-and-response<br>
    9. Ending<br>
    <br>
    Basically, most salsa music starts with an introduction as an 'appetizer', the verse or
    verses as the 'main course', and for the climax of the song, the 'chorus with
    call-and-response' as dessert, and this is where salsa music gets most exciting. This is
    also true for 'romantic salsa' songs, where the percussion ceases sound occasionally,
    before it starts up again; this usually happens at the start of a verse.<br>
    <br>
    To make a salsa performance look varied and not boring, you would probably hold back doing
    intermediate or advanced moves until the middle of the song. Often, such moves will be
    done in the choruses with call-and response. But what if the 'calls and responses' start
    in the beginning of the song (like &quot;Juliana&quot;)? I would then say do the
    intermediate/advanced moves at the beginning, hold back by doing some basic (beginning)
    steps in the middle of of the song, and do some intermediate/advanced stuff near the end
    of the song.<br>
    <br>
    Once you find a salsa song that you love to perform to, listen to it several times so you
    can choreograph moves to that particular song. Listen for the parts of the song I
    mentioned above in the examples--the verse, the chorus, the chorus with the
    call-and-response, the bridges, the breaks, the introduction and the ending. Write them
    down on a piece a paper and select a certain salsa move to coincide with these parts;
    e.g., a dip at the end of the song, or a series of underarm turns in the call-and-response
    choruses, or the forward-backward basic at the start of the song, etc.).<br>
    <br>
    Some of this you will get naturally. If you hear a singer singing over the instruments,
    this is probably the verse part of the song. If you hear trumpets blasting over the
    accompaniment and no singing, this might be an instrumental break. If the singer sings in
    a high range and the accompaniment is slightly louder than it was in the verse, this might
    be the chorus part.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, listen to how many measures the part of the salsa song has. Most parts will have
    8, 16, or 32 measures, with some variations. The choruses that have call-and-response will
    have 4 or 8 measures for the 'call' and another 4 or 8 measures for the 'response'
    (usually repeated up to 4 times or a little longer). An instrumental break might be 16,
    24, or 32 measures also with some variations. Introductions are usually 8 or 16
    measures.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I hope that all of this will help you and you partner perform the salsa demo of your life.<br>
