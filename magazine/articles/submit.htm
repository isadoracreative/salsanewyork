An Article:<br>
</b>
</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hi there. Let me begin by telling you that
I look forward to reading your submission to SalsaNewYork. But before you start
typing away like a mambo-fiend let me list a couple of simple submission rules
first.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Never write anything
    negative about anyone</b>. THIS IS RULE ONE. SalsaNewYork Magazine is a
    positive oriented site. Egos will not come into play. You can have a
    difference of opinion, but never use your article as a means to launch a
    personal attack on anyone.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>The Topic should be dance
    related.</b> SalsaNewYork is a Salsa &quot;DANCE&quot; oriented web-site. We
    love the music, the bands, the CD's etc., but in relation to how they gets
    us grooving to the beat of the clave. Examples of Dance oriented topics:
    Partner-work, Spinning, Turn Patterns, Best dance clubs, Favorite Dance
    events, Social dancing vs. Performing, Open Floor Shines, Performing for the
    first time, Performing with a live band, Club dancing, Choice of dance
    shoes, Choice of Dance Partners, The advantage of dancing with different
    people, Ladies/Men's Styling, Interviews with Instructors and so on and so
    forth. This should give you an idea of what we are looking for.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Length of Articles should
    be between 3 and 8 paragraphs long. </b>For those who need a clue, paragraph
    are usually 2 to 4 sentences long, depending on the length of each sentence.
    At least that was what my English teacher told me eons ago way back when
    there was no such things as personal PC's. Yikes!</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Articles should be e-mailed
    to me at <a href="mailto:MCIACorp@ix.netcom.com">MCIACorp@ix.netcom.com</a>.</b>
    Please make sure that it is written in a MS Word or Word Perfect Document
    and is sent to me as an attachment in your e-mail. Also please let me know
    what type of attachment you have included with your e-mail. You can also
    send me your article within the actual body of your e-mail message. This way
    I should be able to cut and paste your work onto our actual web-site. Due to
    my heavy time constraints I will not be able to use articles written on
    paper. (Thanks for understanding).</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Check grammar please!
    Please double check your grammar.</b> I understand that we all make
    mistakes, God Knows that I make a truckload of them personally, especially
    when you think about all the info I spite out on the web all the time. But
    if I have to start rewriting more than a couple of sentences, I might as
    well write the piece myself.&nbsp; </font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Photos are optional. </b>If
    you do decide to include a photo, please try to e-mail it to me in a
    jpeg/gif format. Please make sure that it is of decent quality. We'll reduce
    the amount of resolution at our end so that it fits the average internet
    user download speed.</font><font face="Arial Black" size="4" color="#008080"><b><br>
    </b>
</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well that's it. Hope that you're
still interested in writing us a piece. I look forward to sharing the dance
floor with you real soon. - <a href="mailto:MCIACorp@ix.netcom.com">Manny
