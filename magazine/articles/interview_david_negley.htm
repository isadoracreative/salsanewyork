  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This Month we interview NY Mambo Instructor <a href="../instructors/david_negley.htm">David
  Negley</a>. David has been part of the NY Mambo scene for several years now.
  He and I have had the pleasure to travel, perform and teach together at
  different times during our mutual mambo career. He has performed at the first
  New York Congreso Mundial de la Salsa and was <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie
  Diaz's</a> assistance instructor for almost three years before on going out on
  his own (with her blessings). People will always find him smiling and laughing
  the night away on the dance floor. Bottom line, David loves to dance and it
  shows on his face. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">This will be his
  second exposure in SalsaNewYork (<a href="../instructors/david_negley.htm">his
  instructor listing </a>was the first).&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:</font></b><b>
        </b>How long have you been dancing mambo and what got you into it?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; About 7 years now.&nbsp; Where did the time
        go?&nbsp; It seems like only yesterday that I was wondering struggling
        with the basic!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY:</b>
        </font>Where did you originally learn how to dance mambo and who was
        (were) your mentors?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; I originally started at Sandra Cameron
        Dance Studio but I took lessons all over NY because I had a constantly
        changing schedule. Then I found a real home at <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy
        Anton's</a> and eventually wound up at <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
        Flores</a>.&nbsp; Jimmy and Nelson were big influences.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY:</b>
        </font>How long have you been teaching mambo and what made you decide to
        teach&nbsp; mambo?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]&nbsp;</b> I've been teaching about 3 years.&nbsp;
        People kept asking Lillian and I why we didn't teach, so we taught some
        workshops.&nbsp; Then <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie Diaz</a>
        asked me to assist her and things just kept going from there.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY:</b></font>
        What do you like most about teaching?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]&nbsp;</b> I love to see people learn and make
        progress.&nbsp; It's also helped my own dancing because you really have
        to break things down and think about them.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:
        </font></b>Why do you think people come to learn from you?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]&nbsp;</b>I suppose they like the way you dance to
        start with. Then, hopefully after they come to your class, they feel
        like you are good at conveying what you want them to learn.&nbsp; I
        think they can also tell that I really enjoy teaching and that I want
        them to learn.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY:</b> Are most of
        your students men or women? and why is that?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; We have a pretty equal mix. That's really
        we're after--it's good when everyone has a partner.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:</font></b>
        What is the hardest thing you find about teaching?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; Probably to get the students to let go of
        their inhibitions and just enjoy the process of learning.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY:</b></font>
        Do you still like to go to clubs and dance socially?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]&nbsp;</b> I still enjoy going out to the clubs and
        dancing socially.&nbsp; It's always great to get together with the Mambo
        &quot;family&quot;, practice new steps and learn from others.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:</font></b>
        How about performing? Do you still perform and who have you performed
        for or with?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; Not currently performing, although we still
        do occasional gigs. I have performed with Sandra Cameron's Student
        Dancers, <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy Anton</a>
        Dancers, <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson Flores</a>
        Student Dancers, Curvos Pellogrosas in Washington DC and at the Copa as
        well performances with my wife Lillian in Norway, Miami and the NYC
        area.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:</font></b>
        Name your favorite on stage performance?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; My favorite was performing at the Copa in
        NYC as a member of Curvos Pellogrosas.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:
        </font></b>What got you into performing and what was your first time on
        stage?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; Nelson Flores pushed me to perform at Side
        Street about 3 years ago.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>SNY:</b> What did you
        feel when you first performed live on stage?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; I was scared as hell.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY:</b></font>
        What advice would you give those just getting into mambo? How can they
        work at getting better at dancing?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; Practice, practice, practice.&nbsp; Get out
        on the floor anywhere you can--including classes and socially.&nbsp;
        Don't worry about getting turned down in the beginning.&nbsp; It's part
        of the process--just look for someone else who will say yes.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:
        </font></b>How best could you describe your way of dancing? of teaching?
        and of performing?<br>
        <b>[Negley, David]</b>&nbsp; I like challenging turns and moves that
        look stylish--not rushed,&nbsp; and that follows through in my teaching.&nbsp;
        I'd much rather see someone do a simple turn very well rather than a
        more complicated turn poorly.&nbsp; I try to make sure everyone has a
        good set of basics before I let them move on and we work on the basics
        in every class.&nbsp; I like<br>
        performances with creativity and a theme--something beyond turn, turn,
        turn, shine, shine, shine.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY:</b></font>
