        ones cultural roots and passing it along to future generations has
        been the objective of <a href="../instructors/carlos_vasquez.htm">La
        Salsa De Hoy Dance Studio and its founder Carlos Vasquez.</a> Carlos
        has strived to keep alive the Latino experience that has suffered
        gradual loss through the assimilation of mainstream American culture.&nbsp;
        Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Carlos actively participated in
        various programs that kept the Latino culture alive in his community.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        In 1995 <a href="../instructors/carlos_vasquez.htm#class">La Salsa De
        Hoy Dance Studio opened its doors in Sunset Park Brooklyn</a> as a
        Bi-lingual, Bi-cultural dance program providing dance instruction to
        neighborhood residents. The program furnishes its participants with the
        basic understanding of the historical and cultural evolution of Latin
        music, artist and current dance trends.&nbsp; The school teaches dance
        styles which include Salsa/Mambo, Cha Cha, Hip-Hop and styling with
        Rumba classes beginning in March 2001.&nbsp; Neighborhood children are
        the studios pride and makeup a large portion of what La Salsa De Hoy is
        all about. <a href="../instructors/carlos_vasquez.htm#children">The
        Sunset Kids dance program teaches children </a>the basics in Salsa/Mambo
        and prepares them to perform at their yearly recital as well as in the
        National Puerto Rican Day Parade. Carlos emphases are not only on dance
        but on instilling the importance of academic excellence to the children.
        It is his belief that there is a strong affinity between self esteem
        and knowledge of ones culture. The Kids programs are designed to
        promote self-esteem and<br>
        self-discipline with participants meeting role models that foster
        interpersonal relationships and healthy attitudes about themselves,
        their heritage and communities.<br>
        <br>
        Students of La Salsa De Hoy have gone on to dance with such groups as <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie
        Torres</a> Dancers and Dance Sport Kids as well as various cultural
        affairs throughout the city and state. The Revelation Dancers are the
        dance troupe that represents the studio and will perform in the 2001
        Congreso De Salsa in Los Angeles California this spring.&nbsp;
        Instructors of La Salsa De Hoy come from diverse backgrounds and have
        many years of dance experience and instruction.&nbsp; One of our
        instructors has graced the Broadway stage in such productions as Little
        Shop of Horrors, Pippin, and The Alvin Ailey Dance Company while others
        have danced in various well-known Latino dance groups and won numerous
        competitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        La Salsa De Hoy Dance Studio is easily accessible and is <a href="../instructors/carlos_vasquez.htm#directions">located
        in the heart of Brooklyns Fifth Avenue commercial district</a>.&nbsp;Sundays
        are the studios socials where students and their guests are invited to
        come and dance the afternoon away from 4:00 to 6:00 P.M.&nbsp; Coming
        this March 2001 we will begin Havana Nights on Fridays from 10:00 to
        3:00 A.M. with a variety of Cuban Song and classic Salsa. The studio has
        grown over the years and we now have three locations conveniently
        located within the same area which amounts to well over three thousand
        five hundred square feet of dance space. La Salsa De Hoy invites all who
        want to experience the best and largest dance studio in<br>
        Brooklyn to come down and take a small taste of what were all about.</font><font
