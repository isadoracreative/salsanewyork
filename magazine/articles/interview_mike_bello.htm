          </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">How long have you been
          teaching mambo and what made you decide to teach mambo?<br>
          MB:</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> I began
          teaching very infrequently in 1989 during the Mambo Society days in
          New York. But, I didn't really start teaching on a regular basis until
          I came out to Los Angeles in August of 1997. I had moved to Palmdale,
          California in June of '97staying with in-laws. My daughter, Julia, was
          born a month later and, in August,&nbsp;my wife, Marisol, our older
          daughter, Mariana, the baby and I settled in the San Fernando Valley.
          After checking the internet and finding SalsaWeb's club listing I came
          onto the salsa scene very quickly and realized that salseros in
          LA&nbsp;did not dance like salseros in NY. I didn't really have
          trouble dancing with them. In fact, I found that they could not dance
          with me on 2. At that time, after trying to get my
          partner-of-the-moment on 2, I&nbsp;had to adjust to their timing (on
          1, 3 and so on) and style. This prompted me to try to get folk to
          understand more about the music, rhythm and dance, you know to better
          understand the reasons behind dancing on 2. I began teaching in a club
          in Marina Del Rey in October 1997 and the rest is history. <o:p>

font-weight:normal">Well, Manny, right now dancing on 2 is catching on and
          starting to build. But, I had a hard time in the beginning because I
          was the only person sticking by my clave guns, so to speak. There were
          maybe a handful of people where I would go dancing that could lead and
          follow on 2. And, really, my main reason for teaching ws to have
          people that&nbsp;I could dance with. That was my real agenda!
          Eventually I came be teaching and spreading the word of the clave as a
          mission. To give dancers of all levels an informed choice in timing
          and to have a better udnerstanding of the rhythms, based on the clave,
          that drive the music and dance. Now, barring the styling (what the
          body is doing) I felt and still feel that anyone can dance on 2 and
          feel what is going on rhythmically.</span></font></p>

          it is the only dance social in L.A. I also just started three

          Do you have a performance team??? Do you plan to form one?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">I had a small
          performance team in 1999 called the Mambo Squad. We had just one
          number that we performed and was strictly a shine routine. I quickly
          found that having a family and doing dance full time leaves little
          time for all else. I'm also not one for performances. I get no real
          thrill from perfoming. There are too many expectations and an extreme
          amount of hard work. So after about 4-5 months the Mambo Squad
          disbanded. I do want to form a children's dance group. ItÂ’s
          wonderful to see kids really get off on salsa. There's this 11 year
          old boy named Tony who has been coming to my socials for almost a year
          and now knows about 40 shines and in a choreographed routine. Its so
          great to see others admire him do his thing. I get&nbsp;a charge out
          of that! So I want to extend that and will be working towards that end
          in the near future!<o:p>

          Have you performed and if so name your favorite on stage performance?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">I got my first taste
          of performing when the Mambo Society closed its doors in the late
          80's. Nydia Ocasio started the Latin Sensations in 1990 where I was a
          backup dancer. In fact the first performance we did was at Brooklyn
          Tech. I got to perform that night because Angel and Addie Rodriguez
          had pulled out (they were just starting Razz M'Tazz). The only routine
          I remember doing was Cayuco. But I have to say that the routine done
          here in L.A., where only shines are done to the tune of Oscar D'Leon's
          version of Que Bueno Baila Usted, is my favorite. The last time this
          was performed was as a scaled down group called the Mambo Men at the
          1st Annual West Coast Salsa Congress.<o:p>

          What is it like to learn a choreographed routine?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Learning one is
          great! You don't really have to create anything. You just have to put
          all the pieces presented together and then just let yourself go! But
          practice is very important. If I remember correctly, we rehearsed
          twice a week for three hours at a stretch. Every detail has to be
          explicit and done precisely on time. I had a great time back in the
          early 90's because I was dancing every day and felt like I needed to
          get my mambo fix constantly. Creating one is another story! There are
          several ways to go about that. In the beginning of the Mambo Squad I
          put together roughly 30 shines in a logical sequence, presented them
          to the group and collectively we honed it down to a piece that
          happened to fit the number. Because the members had to learn new
          footwork it was a long process in not just the accomplishment of the
          pattern but to execute them stylistically in the same manner. This,
          frankly, was just a cookie cutter routine and all we could afford to
          do at the time. Approximately 200 hours later we had a number that was
          workable and presentable. At the time it was a good routine because no
          one in L.A. was doing shines.</span><o:p>

          What did you feel when you first performed live on stage?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">I remember being
          extremely nervous and having cotton mouth. But, after the first 10 to
          20 seconds I felt good and only slightly nervous. In fact, I recall
          making a mistake, laughing it off, keeping a smile on my face and just
          going for it.</span><br>

          <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> What advice would you give
          those just getting into mambo? How can they work at getting better at
          dancing?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Be open minded,
          relaxed and don't give up! Repetition is the mother of memory so be
          sure to practice as often as you can. This doesn't mean boring
          yourself with basic stuff all the time yet you cannot give up on the
          fundamentals. Don't get discouraged if you can't get the hang of that
          one move or step. Keep at it! Do each part separately and then
          together. Dancing mambo is not as simple as it seems. There are a lot
          of nuances and intricacies in every aspect of salsa music and dancing.
          One thing to remember, though, is that it is all attainable!</span><br>
          <br>
          <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> How best could you describe
          your way of dancing? of teaching? and of performing?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">My way of dancing is
          always trying to maintain a flow during the dance and using the energy
          of my partner to help her look good! Because if she looks good, then I
          look good. I try to maintain a fluid approach to dancing mambo.
          I&nbsp;feel a tremendous responsibility to those who come to me for
          instruction. This translates into giving as much information as the
          student can bear without overload. Always be prepared to give the same
          information in a different way because not everyone learns the same
          way. At times I break things down to minutiae. These very specific
          details, I feel and see, help the dancer reach a higher level quicker
          and better. I feel that, when performing, I am looking as comfortable
          as possible by smiling at all times, looking at my audience and
          executing the moves and steps as effortlessly as possible while having
          fun.</span><o:p>

          Do you still like to go to clubs and dance socially?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Sure!&nbsp;I go out
          dancing at least twice a week. This is also partly becuase I'm
          promoting myself when I'm at a club but I'm having a blast! I also
          like to watch people dance and have a good time dancing. Because
          dancing on 2 is my focus and priority, I get a kick out of watching
          those dancers that can dance on 2. A couple of years ago that was very
          few and far between but now there a&nbsp;lot more dancing on 2 and I'm
          just real happy to watch!</span><br>

          <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> How is Mambo dancing where you
          live&nbsp;different from mambo dancing in other parts of the world?<br>
          MB:</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Los Angeles has a
          very aggressive style of dancing with wider dance floor space being
          used as well as longer steps being accomplished. This is slowly
          changing largely in part to the exposure to NY style dancers
          performing and social dancing at Salsa Congresses as well as to
          several on2 dancers based here. I think that every region, though, has
          thier own unique approach based on what their background is
          in&nbsp;salsa/mambo. I find, too, that when given the right
          opportunity and circumstances, many dancers, novice to advanced, are
          thirsty for mambo knowledge.</span><br>

          love for everyone that is serious about dancing mambo, whether it is
          on 1 or 2 or whatever, to be versed enough in clave to understand the
          relationship of the rhythms in salsa music in order to be in sync with
          the&nbsp;music and free in&nbsp;in the dance. I'd also like to see no

        When it comes to the music and dance i can talk about it for days so I
        have to put a check on what i teach sometimes. But, also the challenge
        of the small percentage of people that have a harder time than most to
        get the material. It's semi-difficult for me. Not because I can't find
        the material to help but because I may not be able to find, right away,
        that thing that will make it all click. For example, I have a lady that
        takes my classes and her timing is noticeably off. She can count with me
        but her feet would not be timed to the numbers. Well, in a rotation,
        once, she was dancing with me and instead of counting I just happened to
        vocalize the tumbao and she danced exactly on time. I realized then that
        she needed to focus on the rhyhtm and forget the numbers. I tested that
        theory out with her several times and each time the numbers put her off
        but the tumbao kept her on. So, its difficult for me when&nbsp;I have to
        try to discover what is the key to their trouble.</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><br>
