        Greg has been around the NY/NJ Mambo scene for several years now. He
        usually is a very low key kind of guy who you see having a good time
        dancing in some corner of a club's dance floor. Greg is all about
        harmony and peace and his main philosophy is to always have a good time
        while dancing. Like <a href="../instructors/joyce_blint.htm">Joyce Blint</a>
        last month, this will be Greg's first real exposure to the NY internet
        mambo scene. -Manny</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Greg Taylor-Interview:
</strong></font>
        </p>
        <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">How long have you been mambo dancing
        and what got you into the Mambo dance scene?<br>
        </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have been dancing mambo for
        5years, and I got into it because I saw some<br>
        friends of mine dancing at a club, and it look so nice and elegant. I
        have<br>
        always danced, but this was something I thought I would be good at.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Who do you consider to be your mambo mentors?<br>
        </b>My instructors when I first started were <a href="../instructors/greg_taylor.htm">Ismael
        Otero</a> and Robert Martinez<br>
        from New Jersey<br>
        <br>
        <b>Which are your favorite Salsa Bands?<br>
        </b>I like a lot of people. I'm more of an old school fan. I like Sonora<br>
        Poncena, Fania, Jose Alberto El Canario, and I really love the Latin
        Jazz.<br>
        <br>
        <b>In your opinion, What does it take to learn a dance routine?<br>
        </b>To learn a choreograph routine you really have to focus and be
        capable of doing<br>
        intense rehearsals.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Name your favorite on-stage performance?<br>
        </b>Some of my performances have been with singers such as Frankie
        Negron, Jonny<br>
        Pacheco, Ray Sepulveda, and Fania All Stars at Madison Square Garden<br>
        <br>
        <b>What did you feel when you first performed live on stage?</b><br>
        My first performance was nerve racking, because I had never performed in<br>
        front of a lot of people as far as dancing goes. Since I played football
        in<br>
        college I was use to performing in front of 85,000 people every
        Saturday, but<br>
        dancing was a little different, so I had to make the adjustment. I love
        performing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What do you like about being a dance choreographer?</b><br>
        I like putting together a routine, because I get satisfaction from the
        end<br>
        result. I like working with other dancers when putting a routine
        together,<br>
        but <i><font color="#FF0000">the one thing I stress over and over again
        is to make sure we have fun<br>
        while dancing - that is really what it's about anyway.</font></i><br>
        <br>
        <b>What do you like about performing with a live band?<br>
        </b>Again, I like doing performance to the Latin Jazz, because you can
        hear<br>
        every instruments in the song. All the big bands you can really make it<br>
        easier for a mambo dancer, because you can hear every instruments and
        you can<br>
        appreciate each musician. Clave, Clave, Clave!</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>What advice would you give those
        just getting into mambo? How can they<br>
        work at getting better at dancing?</b><br>
        I would tell someone who is just starting to learn the mambo to make<br>
        sure that they understand the history behind the music, and to have a
        good<br>
        time dancing, that is what is all about. Never get caught up in
        hostility.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How best could you describe your way of dancing? of teaching? and of<br>
        performing?</b><br>
        I would say that my style of dancing is more of a jazzy style and being<br>
        dynamic, but at the same time I can get down with the fast mambo as
        well. I<br>
        like to communicate with my partner as well, which is one of the most<br>
        important things in dancing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What would you like to see happen to mambo within the next few
        years?,<br>
        next decade? within your lifetime?</b><br>
        What I would like to see with the mambo since it is an art form, I would<br>
        like to see it <a href="latin_madness.htm">on Broadway</a>. I also would
        like to see some of the negative<br>
        attitudes that I have been seeing diminished. We as mambo dancers need
        to<br>
        <a href="respect_and_workplace.htm">respect </a>one another, and leave
        the attitude at home. That's why it is<br>
        important to understand the history and music of the mambo. People
        played and<br>
        danced way back in time, because it was the only thing that they had,
        and a<br>
        way of really expressing themselves and their culture. So I hope we can
        keep<br>
        expressing feelings through our dancing and keep it fun.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">
