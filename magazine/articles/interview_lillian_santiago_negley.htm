    Lillian Santiago-Negley</i></font><br>
    </font></b><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: How
    long have you been dancing and what got you into mambo dancing?<br>
    LS:</font></b><font size="2"><font color="#FF0000"> </font>When it comes to
    Mambo,&nbsp;it's been about 7 years and I started because I discovered it
    was a great way to stay in shape and meet many wonderful people.&nbsp; It's
    also a fantastic way to be able to express yourself from the depths of your
    Latin soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be&nbsp;spiritually, emotionally or because
    the passion for dancing is endless and invigorating.&nbsp; Needless to say,
    it helps you get rid of that stress!</font></font>
  </div>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(Laugh) I've been dancing as long as I can
  remember.&nbsp; I've always loved our music and my Dad used to play some great
  big band music in the house all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the type of
  music&nbsp;you would hear at the Palladium or&nbsp;at the Cabo Rorreno in the
  Bronx.&nbsp; Funny&nbsp;how not to many people&nbsp;may know about this
  popular place back in the day.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;But, I always remember a story that my
  father told me about the days when he used to&nbsp;go to the&nbsp;Cabo in the
  Bronx on Prospect Avenue.&nbsp; One day he went into the club and it was&nbsp;
  crowded and the night was full of excitement.&nbsp; But most importantly, what
  he saw before him had him mesmerized!&nbsp; There was the woman who became my
  mother dancing on one of the tables with her sisters and friends having a
  great time!&nbsp; They met dancing and the rest is history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny....but
  the same thing happen to me except I still haven't danced on the table.&nbsp;
  I really loved that story.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2"><font color="#FF0000">SNY: What was
  it that got you into teaching?<br>
  LS:</font> </font></b><font size="2">Well, I remember when I was learning from
  <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">
  Jimmy Anton</a> how much fun it used to be.&nbsp; It was a place where I was able
  to release my inhibitions and make people laugh and smile.&nbsp; I always saw
  Jimmy having such a good time and noticed the satisfaction in his expressions
  when he realized he's made a difference in someone's life.&nbsp; The joy in&nbsp;someone's
  smile is immeasurable and it's&nbsp;very gratifying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So for me, it's basically the same feeling.&nbsp;
  I love to see my students get excited whether it's in a private or in a class
  environment after having learned a few shines or turn patterns.&nbsp; Making
  them feel special, happy and challenged is very rewarding.</font>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: Who would you
  say are people you consider your mentors?<br>
  LS: </font></b><font size="2"><a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy
  Anton</a>.&nbsp; Jimmy has a refreshing,
  smooth and unique style.&nbsp; Most, importantly he knows how to be playful
  and never hesitates to let you enjoy and express yourself in your own way.&nbsp;
  As a choreographer, I've had several opportunities to perform with him and one
  of his dancing groups several years ago.&nbsp; The original Jimmy Anton &quot;Familia&quot;.&nbsp;
  (Nice memories to last a lifetime!!)</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jimmy's creativity and willingness to let you
  give your input was always very positive and encouraging.&nbsp; It really was
  and will always be memorable experience.&nbsp; Some of our best times together
  with the &quot;fun&quot; crew.&nbsp; You know who you are!</font></p>
  <b><font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana" size="5"><img src="../images/LillianSantiago_class.JPG" border="0" align="right" width="216" height="162"></font></b><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: What would you say
  mambo dancing has done for you (personally, socially, professionally)?<br>
  LS:</font></b><font size="2"> Mambo has given me the opportunity to meet&nbsp;many
  interesting and wonderful people from all over the world.&nbsp; I've had so
  many great experiences traveling,&nbsp;performing&nbsp;celebrating
  birthday's, weddings and even seeing future Mambo dancers being born, from
  some of my dearest friends who have been married and met through dancing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On a more personal note,&nbsp;I've been
  blessed with many special people&nbsp;who have come into my life with&nbsp;whom
  we've mutually shared some of the most saddest times in our&nbsp;lives such as
  a loss of a parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;By comforting each other through our dance
  we've been able to realize how precious&nbsp;and beautiful life can be and&nbsp;how
  much&nbsp;dancing can give you the inner strength and positive energy to help
  you move on with your life.&nbsp; As strange as it may seem, it can be a very
  healing experience.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On a professional level thinking about
  where and&nbsp;when&nbsp;the next venue is helps me get through the day in the
  Corporate world!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: What do you think
  is the best thing that you've gotten out of dancing?&nbsp;<br>
  LS: </font></b><font size="2">Besides <a href="../instructors/david_negley.htm"> meeting and marrying my soul mate</a> I
  can't think of anything else. (SMILE) Well alright maybe one more
  thing.....I have to say that it helps me stay in shape and it's a great
  feeling to see so many people from around the world appreciating and learning
  about our Latin heritage.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: Do you still go
  out to dance socially and if so what are some of your favorite spots?<br>
  LS: </font></b><font size="2">Yes, on occasion.&nbsp; Some of my favorite
  spots are <a href="jimmy_anton_social.htm"> Jimmy Anton's socials</a>, Bistro Latino, El Flamingo and one our newest
  venues the &quot;Supper Club&quot;.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY: Do you still
  actively teach? If so where?<br>
  LS:</b></font> Yes.&nbsp; I do privates and help my husband teach.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000"><b>SNY: Are is your
  favorite thing about teaching?<br>
  LS: </b></font>What is my favorite thing about teaching?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a
  lot
  of fun.&nbsp; I help my students let go of their inhibitions, make them laugh
  and help them feel confident by giving them compliments all the time.&nbsp; I
  tell them to look at themselves in the mirror and do whatever makes them feel
  good as they get more and more comfortable.&nbsp; It helps keep them&nbsp;encouraged&nbsp;and
  they don't even want to take a&nbsp;break!&nbsp; Which is&nbsp;very
  gratifying.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY: Do you still
  like taking classes?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  LS:</font></b> Yes I do.&nbsp; But, I like to take other classes such as
  Hustle so that I can incorporate the movements into other dances such as
  Mambo.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY:</font></b><font color="#FF0000"><b>
  What do you think of the development of mambo as a performing art over the
  last few years (Mambo Showdowns, Congresses/Conventions, Latin Madness, Salsa
  Dance Awards)?<br>
  LS:</b></font><b> <font color="#FF0000"> </font></b><a href="latin_madness_home.htm">Latin
  Madness</a> was
  one of the best shows I've seen.&nbsp; Not only with all the talent that
  evolved on stage but it was one of the first venues that I can say, everyone
  left their negative thoughts outside of the theatre and developed a
  &quot;Latin&quot; fusion.&nbsp; Even though the performers were all unique in
  the way they expressed themselves&nbsp;there was one&nbsp;common goal to
  achieve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their efforts, ideas, talents and camaraderie were
  all achieved and it was displayed within a group effort in a classy way.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY: How was it that you met your husband
  David?</font></b><br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><b>
  LS:</b></font> I met <a href="../instructors/david_negley.htm"> David</a> when I was taking a
  <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm"> Jimmy Anton class</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: Would you say
  that your <a href="http://www.on2productions.com/wedding.htm">wedding a mambo
  wedding</a>?<img height="262" src="articles_images/llillian_david_Brid__Groom_Crew.jpg" width="197" align="left"><br>
  LS:</font></b><font size="2"> No not necessarily, but&nbsp;dancing was the way
  we met.&nbsp; So of course, we had our &quot;Mambo&quot; family with us who
  brought along some Mambo tunes!&nbsp; Ron McGugins was one of our DJ's so you
  can just imagine.&nbsp; We wouldn't have had it any other way!</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY: Do you have any
  mambo plans in the near or distant future?<br>
  LS:</font></b> At this time, we will continue to teach at Stepping out and
  aside from that keep on dancing!</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY: What do you
  think a person should be looking for in an instructor when learning how to
  dance mambo?<br>
  LS:</font></b> I feel an instructor should be: 1)&nbsp;Someone who is very
  detailed oriented and can explain things clearly and in an easy way to
  understand for a female as well as a male student; 2)&nbsp; Someone who is
  patient and always encouraging; 3) Someone who&nbsp;can help you let go of
  your inhibitions and&nbsp;help you feel sexy; 4) Someone who points out the
  simplest things that some people don't think about such as how to hold your
  partner's hand and keep a &quot;hook&quot; so you don't loose contact; 5)
  Creative and 6) Professional and always fun.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="2">SNY: What do you
  think someone looking to teach should do before opening up a class?<br>
  LS: </font></b><font size="2">1) Learn about the music's history and some of
  the most famous artists; 2) Learn the beats/measures of the music and 3) Talk
  to dancers and just ask their opinions on their likes and dislikes.&nbsp; It
  can help you develop a good clientele if you know what people want or need and
  help you understand how people think and what's important to them as&nbsp;individuals.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#FF0000">SNY: What is your
  advise to all those beginner mambo dancers wanting to get into performing.<br>
  LS: </font></b>1) Be patient; 2) You have to crawl before you walk and the
  more you practice the better you will be; 3)&nbsp; It is not about you. It's a
  team effort; everyone&nbsp;has to pitch in; 4) You need to be dedicated,
  responsible and honest; 5)&nbsp; Be creative.&nbsp; Let yourself go and share
  your ideas and interests.&nbsp; Sharing your love and knowledge for the dance
  is very gratifying and makes you a better person; 6)&nbsp; Be able to make the
  distinction.&nbsp; Certain moves/patterns are only for the stage and don't
  need to take place at a social unless you're performing.&nbsp; Always, be
  considerate of your fellow dancers and 7) Help keep the peace and keep that
  passion flowing!</font></p>
