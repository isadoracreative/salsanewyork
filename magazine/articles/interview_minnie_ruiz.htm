        How popular is Salsa Dancing in Hawaii?&nbsp;<br>
        MR:</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> It has become
        the hottest dance in Hawaii. Everybody wants Salsa! When I first arrived
        in Hawaii in 1990, I was the first Mambo Dance Instructor here &amp; I
        gave free dance lessons at the Ala Wai Golf Course. There were not&nbsp;many
        clubs that play Salsa. Only one club&nbsp;called Acqua with live music.
        It was then I met Rolando Sanchez &amp; Salsa Hawaii, Nancy Ortiz &amp;
        Ray Cruz. They are the true pioneers of promoting Salsa in Hawaii. They
        have been promoting Salsa for over 20 years.<o:p>

        Why do you think that Salsa Dancing has become more popular in Hawaii
        over the last few years?<br>
        MR:</b> With the exposure of some Salsa websites &amp; having&nbsp;Univision
        bring one of the hottest Miami base shows &quot;Caliente&quot; to tape
        in Hawaii, &nbsp;it has giving us exposure all over the world</font></p>

        Who have you helped bring to Hawaii to help promote the art of salsa
        dancing?<br>
        </span>MR:</b> Well, we had <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">Addie
        Diaz</a> and her <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com">Addie-Tude Dance
        Company</a> for the 12th Annual Latin Music Festival. They were the
        first to promote the &quot;On 2&quot;. They updated me on some of these
        hottest moves. I also, had the pleasure of working with <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson
        Flores</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.descargalatina.com">Descarga Latina
        Dance Company</a>. We are have having more &amp; more dancers coming to
        Hawaii. We are having&nbsp; someone coming in the months to follow that
        has been around for a long-long time but just keep checking out the the
        websites for more information.</font></p>

        </span>MR:</b> I see Hawaii as one of the hottest Salsa </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">places
        to dance. We have many Japanese that come here to dance Salsa,
        especially for the Hawaii International Latin Music Festival held each
        year &amp; the Hispanic Festival held at the Kapiolani Park&nbsp;hosted
        by&nbsp;Hispanic Chamber </font><img border="0" src="articles_images/ADC_minnie_addie_gina_a.JPG" align="left" width="287" height="216"><font face="Verdana" size="2">of

        Do you ever envision a congress being organized on the island?<br>

        congress, not only do you Salsa but you can enjoy&nbsp;paradise too
        &amp; also learn to dance the Hula. We are getting alot of exposure.&nbsp;Here

        Right now, I teach mostly privates but I do have a beginner/intermediate
        group class on Wednesday nights. I get anywhere from 10 to 30 students.
        Each week is different, sometimes less &amp; sometimes more. I go out to
        shopping malls, parks, special events &amp; give complementary lessons
        to promote&nbsp; Salsa.&nbsp;I&nbsp;teach&nbsp;them the application of&nbsp;clave
        timing &amp; how to feel the music. That is very important to me. When
        the students feel the music they will know how to play&nbsp;on the dance
        floor.</span></font></p>

        I do not perform like when I lived in New York during 70's &amp; 80's.
        That was my prime time. I have done some performance here like for the
        Cinco De Mayo festival a couple&nbsp; of years ago with the legendary
        Tito Puente, Sheila E, Pete Escovedo &amp; our very own hottest Salsa
        band Rolando Sanchez. I &nbsp;have&nbsp;also danced at the Hawaii Music
        Awards, Parks, Schools &amp; some of the hottest Salsa Clubs in Hawaii.
        I basically love to teach &amp; when I feel the music my students also
        feel the music<o:p>

        It is growing immensely! Not only latinos are dancing Salsa, we have

        I have been dancing mambo for about 20 years now. When I was 15 I use<br>
        to go to La Villas in Upstate NY with my family and I would watch this
        guy<br>
        named Lenny dance. He was fabulous. He noticed how I stared at him so he<br>
        asked me to dance and my legs were shaking, but I wanted to learn so bad
        that I could taste it. He lives in the Bronx.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>

        mambo and what made you decide to teach mambo?<br>
        MR:</b> I have been teaching for about 15 years now. I started with the
        hustle. I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>learned the
        hustle from the dance dimensions and I followed the yellow brick road&nbsp;
        into the mambo. <o:p>

        What do you like most about teaching?<br>
        MR:</span></font></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana">
        The fact that I am introducing salsa to another human being. Letting<br>
        them know how passionate and exciting this dance is.<br>
        <br>
        <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> Why do you think people come to
        learn from you?<br>
        MR:</b> They are learning from the best here in Hawaii. The comments
        that I received are very positive. They said wow! You are a very good
        teacher; you explain every detail about teaching. I let them know how to
        lead and how important it is because if a guy can not lead, his partner
        will not be able to follow. I show them the way you hold your
        partners hand, the footwork, style, etc.<br>
        <br>
        <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> Are most of your students men or
        women? and why is that?<br>
        MR:</b> I have more men than women only because they feel comfortable
        with<br>
        me and from my side they ask what the female partner loves to do on the
        dance<br>
        floor the most. I help them and inform them that the ladies love to have
        fun on<br>
        the dance floor.<br>
        <br>
        <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> Do you still like to go to clubs
        and dance socially?<br>
        MR:</b> I do sometimes only because I love salsa with a passion and I
        like to<br>
        hear the music. When you understand what the song is saying it is more
        fun<br>
        to dance. I don't go dancing every week like I did when I lived in NY.<br>
        <br>
        <b><span style="color:red">SNY:</span> How about performing? Do you
        still perform and who have you<br>
        performed for or with?<br>
        MR:</b> I've done a few performance here but mostly solo Palladium
        style. Here<br>
        we have good dancers but I have not found the perfect partner. I
        performed for the Miss Latin Hawaii Pageant along with Rolando Sanchez
        and Salsa Hawaii. They play the best in Latin music.</font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana"><o:p>
