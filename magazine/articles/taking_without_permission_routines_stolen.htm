      <br>
      It's funny, a few weeks ago, I was scanning through the 2001 LA Congress
      tapes and noticed that someone also used the identical jamboree that I
      choreographed in the 99 Puerto Rico Congress.<br>

      </span>Speaking of the devil!<br>
      <br>
      .. now, the reason why I thought of you is because this past
      Saturday I went to a concert commemorating Tito Puente. It was pretty big,
      there were lots of bands and <b><span style="color:red">local area</span></b>
      performers. Well, I know you will get upset but you don't think that 4
      guys went up to dance while the band was playing and they did the male
      solo to YOUR Mama Guela???? THEY TOTALLY COPIED IT from beginning to end!
      You should have seen me, my jaw was on the floor. I recognized the
      choreography instantly and there they were, on stage, doing the steps
      (never as clean, of course!) and they got a banging applause! I don't know
      who they were, they weren't announcing dancers but I thought I'd let you
      know. I don't know what kind of rights you have about copyrighting
      choreography, but I am sure this is not the first time you hear of this
      happening.<br>
      <br>
      On another note, you can take it as a partial compliment! I assume they
      got the choreography from the west coast congress tapes since there were
      some dance teams from <b><span style="color:red">bla..bla.</span></b>
      out there. but I was sooooooooooo blown away, I was buggin! Well, keep in
      touch. Say hi to the team for me, please.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

      From NY Mambo Mamas Dance Director Abbey Plotkin<br>
      </b>We saw the SAME thing happen in the 1st Montreal Congress. &nbsp;A
      Canadian team copied Johnny Vazquez &amp; Olivia's routine STEP FOR STEP,
      same music, even to the point of the female smiling and looking to the
      audience at the same time as Olivia did!! &nbsp;I think it is
      DISGUSTING!!!! &nbsp;Now, if they said before or after the performance
      that this is the routine of <b><span style="color:red">so &amp; so</span></b>
      or<b><span style="color:red"> so &amp; so</span></b>, it would be
      one thing, but to try to pass this off as one's own and take the applause
      of an unknowing audience should be a criminal act as far as I'm concerned.
      &nbsp;Dance teams work WAY too hard and already get less than their
      deserved respect from lay-people without being ripped off by other
      dancers! Obviously, nothing's new and dance has been around since mother
      Africa but to rip someone off step for step is unnecessary. &nbsp;At least
      switch the steps around and use different music!!!!!<br>
      Just my opinion...<br>

      <b>From A West Coast Dancer</b><br>
      I have a question for everybody especially<br>
      choreographers and performers out there.&nbsp; How do they<br>
      feel when somebody steals one of their routines. I'm<br>
      asking this because as many of you would know Rony and<br>
      I have a situation right now.&nbsp; We have won several<br>
      competitions with the Matrix routine and a lot of<br>
      people know that. Rony and I were in Mexico for Luis<br>
      and Joby's wedding and while we were there we got<br>
      several calls saying that <b><span style="color:red">another known L.A.
      Dancer</span></b> copied our<br>
      routine and he was promoting it as his own idea, and<br>
      that really bother me because Rony and I worked really<br>
      hard for that routine.&nbsp; Some said it was the same<br>
      routine and other said it was only the beginning and<br>
      what pisses me more is that he was saying that it was<br>
      his own idea.&nbsp; Come on, you would think that <b><span style="color:red">this
      other<br>
      dancer</span></b> would have a brain to do his own concept, he has<br>
      taught salsa for like 200 years I imagine he can make<br>
      a routine of his own.&nbsp; Like somebody told me yesterday<br>
      coming up with the concept of a routing is like 50% of<br>
      the routine, you want to be &quot;ORIGINAL&quot;, clean, select<br>
      music and customs. I don't think is fair just to put a<br>
      video in a VCR and copy the ideas and the customs of<br>
      somebody else and dared to say it was your idea!!!<br>
      <br>
      So just because <b><span style="color:red">so &amp; so</span></b>
      liked our routine he copied it<br>
      and made it now saying it was his own idea, so watch<br>
      out all the choreographers out there he might come out<br>
      with a routine like soldiers routine from Rumberos, or<br>
      Angels &amp; Devil from Salsa Brava or who knows maybe the<br>
      Egyptian routine from Eddie and Al. Don't be surprise<br>
      if he does come out with those routines and say its<br>
      his own creation!!!!!!<br>
      <br>
      I know none of us own the concept of these routines<br>
      but remember that copies never come out as good as the<br>
      originals!!! .<br>

      Ah..another Starlite event, one of the much heard about dance nights in<br>
      the Bronx, el Condado de la Salsa. In reviewing the email (though I dont<br>
      know how I got onto the mailing list) I see that there will be more top<br>
      performances from some of NY/NJ's best, and it promises to be another<br>
      heart pounding, sweaty, intense experience, hosted by <a href="../instructors/luis_zegarra.htm">Luis
      Zegarra</a>.&nbsp; And<br>
      at the bottom of the email the terse warning- &quot;No videotaping!&quot;.
      *sigh*<br>
      Being a social dancer, performer, instructor, and observer, I have come<br>
      to realize that video taping can be annoying. Video taping can be<br>
      intrusive. Video taping can be abusive. And for the benefits gained, I<br>
      wouldn't give up videotaping to save myself from the harm that it does,<br>
      because ultimately I think it's advantages far outweigh the annoyance.<br>
      Imagine a video of Tito Puente's first performance at the Palladium. To<br>
      actually just get a chance to see what the event was like, how people<br>
      dressed, how they danced, the music they listened to, the mistakes, the<br>
      flairs, the gangsters at their private tables, the fights, anything that<br>
      gives us a window to that era. How intangibly invaluable would something<br>
      like that be?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
      if there's a video of <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie
      Torres'</a> first dance competitions that<br>
      he was winning back to back, coming with a different show every time,<br>
      doing things that no one had ever seen. Seeing Eddie when he was smaller.<br>
      When he could move even faster. When he was playing with concepts that<br>
      hadn't been touched before. How many appointments would you cancel in<br>
      order to be able to watch those tapes with someone?<br>
      How would you like to watch a complete video of the Fania All Stars<br>
      concert at the Cheetah? Not the cut-and-take, edited for content version,<br>
      but the raw footage. Missed cues, cracked voices, inspired soneos, the<br>
      intensity of seeing the event unfolding?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
      about a descarga recorded en El Monte?<br>
      Edie the Salsa Freak when she was learngin how to do a right turn?<br>

      For some of the above events there are snatches of recordings, and they<br>
      become more valuiable as the years turn,because they are recordings of a<br>
      time, of a point in the learning experience, ultimately of history.&nbsp;
      Yet,<br>
      none of these things are being (legally) captured at the mambo showdowns,<br>
      because of the &quot;no video taping&quot; rule. They tell us that the
      rule exists<br>
      to protect the dancers, protect the routines from being stolen.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
      no one captures them, then the worst thief will be time. I vaguely<br>
      remember the performances from the Mambo Showdown almost a year ago, in<br>
      January. I know I got some good dances in, though I dont really remember<br>
      with who. Had I been able to bring my camera and been able to capture some<br>
      moments of the event, then I wouldn't have to try and remember who was<br>
      where when I'm telling my grandkids about the days I used to dance more.<br>
      Without fast forwarding so far, even when I return to DC and tell people<br>
      about the great time I had in NY, they want to see footage. They dont want<br>
      to believe that there are girls that can easily spin 15 times on a dime.<br>
      They can't imagine Ismael dancing so in tune with a song that you suspect<br>
      he was in the studio when it was originally laid down. They have a hard<br>
      time seeing a girl do a syncopated pachange in heels.&nbsp; I try to keep
      that<br>
      in mind when I go to a social that does allow video taping. I will take a<br>
      break for a few songs and just walk around and record people, not because<br>
      they're doing turn patterns that I will dissect and copy verbatim, but for<br>
      posterity's sake and to spread the fever.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
      was recently in a performance that the director forbid videotaping,<br>
      and forbade anyone from pulling out their camera when our performance<br>
      started. There was to be one camera, which belonged to the director. Our<br>
      performance was awesome. We caught every cue, kept our positions. Guess<br>
      what? The one recording we had didn't turn out well at all. We lost the<br>
      entire show. I had a friend that had his camera in his bag but didn't<br>
      take it out because of the rule.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
      the East Coast Congress, video taping was once again disallowed. I<br>
      performed there and saw that the congress was being officially recorded.<br>
      Yet it's now several months later and I've heard nothing about the video<br>
      being available to anyone. So who has the recording? If that recording<br>
      doesn't come out, if the tape get's lost, or the studio burns down, then<br>
      once again, a world-class event will exist only in fading memories.&nbsp;
      How<br>
      does that protect the dancer?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Recently
      the Santo Rico dance company had a large part of their footwork<br>
      copied and performed on another side of the country. The director was<br>
      furious, and rightfully so. The recording was most likely taken from their<br>
      performance at the LA salsa congress, where video taping of the<br>
      performances is allowed. However, think of the hundreds of other cameras<br>
      that were recording the event and taking it back to show people in<br>
      Holland, Germany, Hawaii, Brazil, Japan, Chicago, Alabama. To have one<br>
      person copy a section and perform it is not nearly as high a price to pay<br>
      as only having the few thousand people that were able to fly to LA that<br>
      weekend ever see your show.&nbsp; If more people had seen the Santo Rico<br>
      performance on tape, then the possibility of someone ripping it off and<br>
      performing it goes down dramatically, since they would be caught so<br>
      easily.<br>
      <br>
      I have one tape from the 1999 Congress in Puerto Rico. It was the only<br>
      video I had while living abroad for 7 months. It's got some of the<br>
      greatest dancers on it. Felipe Polanco, Eddie Torres, <a href="../instructors/frankie_martinez.htm">Frankie
      Martinez</a>,<br>
      Ismael Otero, Santo Rico, Jai and Candy, Los Rumberos, Salsabrava. I<br>
      studied that tape intensely for 7 months, looking at what the best people<br>
      do, how they dance, the moves, the style. Guess what? I still don't dance<br>
      like any of them. But I use the tape every time I want to show someone how<br>
      good it's possible to get. And I'm sure that if the dancers on the tape<br>
      knew how many people they were influencing, they wouldn't disapprove.<br>
      <br>
      I would hate to see some of the greatest dancing events in NY be forever<br>
      lost, in this day and age that anyone can purchase a camera with 20x zoom,<br>
      that can capture in pitch black, correct for shaking hands, and fits in<br>
      your breast pocket. Perhaps some compromise can be reached on the &quot;No<br>
      videotaping&quot; rule at the Starlite events. Prohibiting videotaping of
      the<br>
      performances, but allowing it for the social dancing. Or a sign that says<br>
      &quot;Please ask before video taping people&quot;.&nbsp; Every event that
      doesn't get<br>
      recorded is a lost opportunity to show future generations &quot;how we
      used to<br>
      do it!&quot; I look forward to your response.<br>

      Both sides seem to have valid reasons to do what they think is best for
      the art, craft and hard work of dancers and their performances. Speaking
      as a professional performer and member of four separate performing unions
      (SAG, DGA, AFTRA &amp; AFTRA), the best thing to do is to first secure
      permission from the artist/artists in question. Not just because this is
      the right thing to do, but because its a matter of professional
      respect. We have no right (legally speaking) to tape people without their
      consent and that's the bottom line. That's why the professionals in the
      business usually secure a release/waiver when recording people. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
