<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You ever think of how great it
must be to be a professional mambo dancer. You get to travel around the world to
perform, meet other famous dancers, share the stage with many world renown Latin
musicians and bands, perform at concerts; while making a decent living doing it.
All you have to do is get up there and dance for a couple of minutes, get some
applauds, get paid and go home right? Piece of cake. Easy Money. Sounds great
right? I even know of promoters who believe that. Well think again. Being a
professional mambo dancer may fulfill many dreams, but making a living is not
necessarily one of them. Its basically a cost draining profession. I should know
since Ive danced with <b>The <a href="../instructors/nelson_flores.htm">Nelson Flores</a>

 Ive also been fortunate enough to dance on stage with Tito Puente &amp;
Celia Cruz, traveled to such places as <a href="http://www.salsaweb.com/ny/ny_articles/hknymambo.html">Hong
Kong</a>, <a href="http://www.addie-tude.com/articles_euro_addie_switzerland.htm">Switzerland</a>,

and Baltimore; and performed at the 3<sup>rd</sup>  Annual Congreso Mundial de
la Salsa in Puerto Rico. My resume is no way as extensive as many of the top
NY/NJ performers, but its enough to qualify me to give you the inside scoop on
what its like being a professional mambo dancer.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lets face it, being a professional mambo dancer
is not cheap. There are costs that need to be covered. For example, some dancers
continue to take classes in order to further refine their dancing skills or pick
up new turn patterns and/or open floor shines. Other dancers feel the need to
take classes in order to maintain their edge over other upcoming dancers.
Competition is real heavy in areas like NY and LA. Especially for women in NY
where there is a greater ratio of professional female dancers over male dancers.
At $15 to $20 dollars per class, a dancer could chalk up a minimum of $60-$80 a
month if they only averaged one class per week.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then there is the need to search
for that perfect mambo song every dancer is looking to choreograph and perform
to. As many of you know a typical Latin CD can run anywhere between $12-$17
dollars. Imagine how many records the average dancer buys each year and tag that
to his annual professional expenses. Also, in their never quest for professional
perfection, dance companies turn to DJs to help them spice up their numbers
by using CD burners to add sound effects or cut melodies together. This can add
up to yet another musical expense.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next there is the cost of a rehearsal studio.
Most dance studios in New York can run from a minimum of $15 to a maximum of $30
dollars an hour. Choosing the cheapest rehearsal space is not as easy as it
looks. Dancers usually compete with other renters (other dancers, dance
instructors, acting coaches, exercise classes, martial art classes, etc.) for
studio rehearsal space. Therefore people rent space according to availability
and not price. In other words, if you need it bad enough you'll end up paying
for it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lets not forget about the actual
time dancers sacrifice to perfect their craft. Believe me, there are better
things to do with your free time then to rehearse a dance number. It takes away
from your friends, your family and your personal life. Performing has to be
important to dancers in order for them to go that extra mile. Ive seen
choreographers spend hours, upon hours coming up with routines for specific
songs. There is a lot of work, sweat and tears involved with perfecting a
number. Basically, the choreographer has to come up with the number; the dancers
need to learn the routine until it becomes second nature to them; and finally
each member has to learn how to work the number as a team.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Think thats it. Nope, not
really. It gets better... theres more... how about the expenses of.. that's
right ...costumes! Mambo costumes cant be found at your local Gap clothing
store. They have to be created from scratch. Ive seen my <a href="../instructors/addie_diaz.htm">wife</a>
 sit down and sketch a design for the girls on her team. Then shell go out to
the garment district and hunt and hunt until she finds what shes looking for.
The trip can run her anywhere from $50 and up depending on the material she
purchased. But thats not all. She still has to take the material and the design
to a seamstress and have her sew together the entire costume. That adds even
another expense of an additional $60 dollars plus for every individual costume.
And believe me this is the cheaper way of doing things. Your other option is to
go to a top-of-the-line mambo costume designer. This can mean a purchase tag of
no less than $400 to $500 dollars. I know of designers charging as high up as
$800 to $1,200 dollars for one costume. Male mambo performance usually have it a
little easier than there female counterparts. But costumes still have to be
chosen, purchased and created nonetheless for them too.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While were at it, let not
forget about performing shoes. Men and women usually pay anywhere from $80 to
$150 dollars for a pair of dance shoes. Men usually purchase
black-patent-leather shoes, black &amp; white shoes and plain black shoes; while
women normally have different color shoes to match their very colorful costumes.
The end result: an additional $80 to $200 expense on performance shoes. This is
not including the $75 plus dollars per pair of dance sneakers which mambo
dancers are fond to rehearse with.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think that being a professional dancer is
tougher on women than on men. Women have to worry about additional accessories
such as earrings, necklaces, make-up, stockings and hair products. By the time a
dancer hits the stage for the first time he or she could have spent anywhere
between $400-$1,200 dollars (depending on the total cost of costumes, shoes, accessories,
make-up, music, classes/instruction, rehearsal space, etc). Remember that many
of these costs are recurring (i.e. classes, rehearsal space) and continue to
subtract from the dancers total net profit earnings.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what really sucks about performing is the
amount of work that dancers have to put into their craft. No matter how good a
number is, it still has to be rehearsed. It still has to be perfected. It still
has to be tighten. This takes an extreme amount of dedication. A dancer's job is
never done. They are always in the process of creating new material for their
viewing public. Believe me, as soon as a number has been performed enough times
in the same area (i.e. NY or LA), its time for the choreographer to start all
over again. People get bored and the dance team has to come up with new a
number.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So you ask yourself, &quot;why go through all
this trouble???&quot; Its simple, because we love what we do. We love our craft,
we love to perform and we love our music. Now It would be nice if we got paid
better for it too. So the next time you see a group of mambo dancers performing
at an event, give them a healthy round of applauds. They worked hard for it. - <a href="mailto:MCIACorp@ix.netcom.com">Manny
