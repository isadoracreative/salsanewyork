          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm in a Brazilian nightclub here in
          New York, Club Indigo. The music is Lambada. Theres a dance show.
          Two couples come out, four very attractive young men and women,
          beautiful bodies, wearing little more than loincloths and g-strings.
          Their bodies glisten with oil. They dance, slowly at first, then
          faster and faster. They gyrate, they grind - they are sex personified.
          I love it, the music, the dance, the energy, the sensuality. Its
          sexy and its beautiful. The audience applauds wildly and I applaud
          along with them.<br>
          <br>
          Fast forward a couple of years. Im at a dance social in a dance
          studio here in New York. The music is salsa. Theres a dance show.
          Two couples come out, four very attractive young men and women. The
          men are fully dressed, the women are not. The womens costumes are
          little more than strategically placed cloth held together by strings.
          The music plays, the dance begins. The routine is highly suggestive
          sexually. The dancing is mediocre, actually quite poor. The
          choreography is simple - the women are sex toys, the men are in
          control. The audience applauds; I dont applaud. In fact, I'm
          disappointed, even a bit angry.<br>
          <br>
          Now, Im wondering. Am I the only person who didnt like the show?
          It was a hot, sexy routine with beautiful women. What's not to like?
          Did other people have mixed feelings in spite of the applause? So, I
          asked a couple of men and women what they thought.<br>
          <br>
          Not surprisingly, most of the men liked the skimpy costumes on the
          women. The women were beautiful and largely naked. Some of the women I
          talked to liked the costumes and wished they could get away with
          wearing outfits like those. On the other hand, some women were
          offended (&quot;Yikes!,&quot; one said). The one thing that most
          people did agree on was that there wasn't much of a DANCE routine.
          There were risqué costumes and the choreography had shock value. The
          routine got a lot of attention, but it wasnt about dancing.<br>
          <br>
          So, heres what Im getting at. There are several issues here.
          First, the obvious one.<br>
          <br>
          Are we looking at dance routines that, more and more, trade off talent
          and ability and replace them instead with provocative costumes and
          blatantly sexual choreography? As more people join an explosion of
          dance companies and want to perform, instead of creativity and
          polished execution, are we getting mediocre dance routines with no
          substance to fill the void. For one thing, I don't recall seeing these
          types of performances from the more mature dance companies like those
          of <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> or <a href="../instructors/jimmy_anton.htm">Jimmy
          Anton</a>.<br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, is a <a href="../resources/studio.htm">dance studio</a>,
          where people come to learn and practice dancing, the appropriate place
          for putting on a show like this? There were also a lot of young men
          and women in the audience at the dance studio. Do some of these dance
          shows reinforce unfortunate stereotypes, such as women as merely sex
          objects? Does this serve as an appropriate role model for these young
          people? Moreover, Ive also seen shows at dance studios that
          fantasize violence, abuse, bondage, and other highly provocative
          themes. Are these really the messages you want to present at a dance
          studio social? Hello?!<br>
          <br>
          Let me be perfectly clear. I like dance routines that have a sexual
          component. In fact, there should be sensuality and passion in dancing
           especially in salsa. But, my point is, and this is what I'm
          writing about - it's a matter of degree and a matter of place.
          Performances at dance studios should emphasize DANCING. Anything else
          ought to be secondary - subtle or suggestive  but not in your face!
          That means that costumes and choreography should complement the dance,
          not replace it. The criteria I think is that if people remember only
          the costumes or only the blatantly provocative choreography, then the
          routine didn't do much for dancing and it probably shouldn't be at a
          dance studio.<br>
          <br>
          My disappointment is not with the dancers as much as it is with their
          choreographers. My anger is reserved especially for the promoters, who
          seem to use any excuse to put on a dance show  and charge extra for
          it  and who dont seem to care about the quality of dancing the
          show has to offer!<br>
          <br>
          I know the dancers work hard, often very hard. Not to mention they
          deserve a lot of admiration for just getting out there and performing.
          Its just a shame that sometimes the choreographers and promoters
          dont give them more and better material to work with.&nbsp;</font></p>
