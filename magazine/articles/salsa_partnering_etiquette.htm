    the NY dance scene for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; I use to see him at the Copa when
    I first started dancing myself.&nbsp; A true gentleman dancer, I can think of few other
    people qualified to write about the topic of Partnering and Dance Floor Etiquette.
    &nbsp; He was kind enough to allow us to re-publish this article on SalsaNewYork.&nbsp;<br>

    <h2><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#008080">Ladies ...</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A successful salsa strategy toward dancing all night,
    apart from knowing how to dance, is to be <i>seen dancing</i>. Guys are generally a shy
    lot, but if they know you <i>can</i> and <i>will</i> dance, you'll be dancing all night.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So...Select a good dance club or studio.&nbsp; A place
    with a <i>wide range of ages</i> works best. Some of those older guys can really
    dance!&nbsp; Live music is rarely good dance music - most bands seem oblivious to what a
    good salsa tempo might be.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wear something bright and colorful, and/or slinky and
    sexy - just be sure, whatever it is, it's noticeable!&nbsp; Dance places can be dim as
    dusk, so make sure you don't blend into the shadows.&nbsp; Arrive early and position
    yourself as close to the dance floor as possible.&nbsp; Sit or stand near the dance floor,
    preferably where guys coming off the floor will see you first.&nbsp; And, oh yeh, don't
    congregate with a group of women.&nbsp;&nbsp; No guy is going to walk up to several women
    hanging together and risk that kind of rejection.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Smile till it hurts!&nbsp; If you don't <i>look</i> like
    you're enjoying yourself, you probably won't be!&nbsp; Don't be afraid to make eye
    contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, &quot;Yes!&quot; to the first dance offer, <i>no matter who it
    is</i>, and <i>keep on saying it</i>.&nbsp; This is the <i>most important rule!</i>&nbsp;
    Being picky is counter-productive, so lose the attitude!&nbsp; If you're <i>seen</i>
    saying no, you'll be left with only the blind and the bold - a small, and not necessarily
    cute, minority.&nbsp; The point of saying <i>yes</i> every time is to <i>increase</i> your
    chances of meeting talented, interesting dance partners. If you do this right, good
    dancers will soon monopolize your time anyway.&nbsp; Ask good dancers to teach you
    something new! They'll usually be happy to oblige and will seek you out in the future.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh, and don't chew gum - or if you have to, do it with
    your mouth closed.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;</font> </p>
    <h2><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#008080">Guys ...</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the above and then...</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Find a smiling gal who's near the dance floor and ask her
    to dance.&nbsp; But for godsake, learn how to, first, and remember - <i>smooth is as good
    or better than fancy! </i>A couple of basic steps done correctly and on tempo is more fun
    for your partner than a dozen pretzel turns done badly with the timing all screwed up.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Avoid dancing roughly - like pulling your partner's arm
    out of its socket.&nbsp; It's bad form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, you want to look good, and
    you can look really good if you make your partner look good.&nbsp; Make eye contact -
    dancing is about communication.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dance with all sorts of partners, it'll make you a better
    dancer, not to mention, it'll make you seem like a nice guy.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">ALSO, if you haven't showered, shaved, or brushed your
    teeth for a while, it might be a good idea to do that <i>first!</i>&nbsp; You don't want
    women to be pointing you out for the wrong reasons!<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;</font> </p>
    <h1><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#008080">Dance Floor Etiquette ...</font></h1>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, there are rules about dance floor rights and
    wrongs.&nbsp; Here are some of them...</font> <ul>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not cool to stand right ON the dance floor to
        socialize.&nbsp; Even experienced dancers, who should know better, sometimes stand right
        on the dance floor talking, drinking, smoking.&nbsp; Do what you like, but do it AWAY from
        the dance floor!</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Speaking of which... be nice to fellow dancers and avoid
        bumping into them.&nbsp; If it's crowded on the floor - and these days most floors are
        crowded, dance small.&nbsp; Most important, try to remember, your partner is not
        disposable - don't toss her around like a bowling ball.</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">A hardwood dance floor should be treated with care.&nbsp;
        Drinks and cigarettes on the dance floor are a NO NO! When you spill liquid on a hardwood
        floor, it becomes a hazardous wet spot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when it dries, this spot is
        pretty much ruined for dancers the rest of the night because it becomes &quot;tacky&quot;
        and you can't slide across it.</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are a beginning dancer, remember that everyone out
        there has probably experienced that same sweaty palm, stiff-as-a-board, jittery
        feeling.&nbsp; It will pass.</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you or your partner screw up a step, get past the urge
        to argue about who's screwing up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember - there are no mistakes!&nbsp; It's
        ONLY dancing, and everyone's there to have fun.</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you're a woman who's not being asked to dance, try
        standing near the edge of the dance floor; smile, tap your foot, and look like you really
        NEED to dance to this song.&nbsp; Make eye contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance with the first
        person who asks.&nbsp; Once you get out there a couple of times with different partners,
        other potential partners will know you won't turn them down.&nbsp; ALSO, don't be afraid
        to ask guys to dance.&nbsp; It's cool!</font> </li>
      <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Last point.&nbsp; I don't mean to offend anyone, but if
        you want to look good dancing salsa, you should <i>not</i> take salsa dance lessons from a
        ballroom instructor unless they have a real clear idea of the differences.&nbsp; Nothing
        looks dumber than a salsero/salsera doing affected hand and toe pointing poses like a
        theatrical ballet dancer.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One point that bears repeating, and can't be made
    strongly enough is:&nbsp; DON'T dance in a way that's going to invite a problem or result
    in collisions with nearby couples.&nbsp; All too often, I've seen dancers on a crowded
    floor with no consideration whatever for other dancers.&nbsp; I think the problem is more
    of an &quot;ego&quot; thing than a lack of dance etiquette.&nbsp; I've seen otherwise
    excellent dancers, who should know better, do stuff they shouldn't be doing simply because
    they get into their &quot;performance&quot; mode and suddenly they're leading with their
    elbows and their butts - their brains totally turned off.&nbsp; They bump nearby dancers
    and swing their partners around to clear more space for themselves.&nbsp; Short of
    physical confrontation, and sometimes it comes to that, there isn't a lot that can be
    done.&nbsp; You can either bump back, or move.&nbsp; The choice depends on the state of
    your own ego and the size of the offending dancer.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lead with your brain, not your butt, and make the effort
    to be more aware and considerate of your dance environment.&nbsp; Otherwise, some of us
    will need to sign up for karate classes to go with our salsa classes.</font></p>
