  <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><o:p></b></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am passionate about dancing salsa.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I can't give a very
  good answer why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've thought
  about it a lot, but one single, unanswerable answer escapes me.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It could be because
  I've met an eclectic group of people<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>-
  editors, executives, students, bodybuilders. Maybe I love
  dancing salsa because I meet rumberas from throughout the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I've danced with lovely women of every age and size from Norway to
  Malaysia to Korea to the Dominican Republic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Perhaps it is the
  rhythm, the contagious beat of the clave and timbales.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It could be that,
  in an age of computerized music, salsa relies on real musicians. Maybe just because
  it's fun.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My spirit soars
  when I am dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My feet are
  moved for me, as though I'm floating in the music, my arms sometimes cradled
  around another dancer, communicating playfully something primal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My stomach lifts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  am barely in control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't
  describe it. Which is why I use
  the word <b> &quot;spirit.&quot;</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some have told me
  that there is nothing spiritual about dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span><b>One woman told me that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Salsa
  is about sex - &quot;a vertical expression of a horizontal desire&quot;</b> she
  quoted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Man and woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Nothing more.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course it's fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's
  been programmed like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
  you shouldn't be going out dancing so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>You're not supposed to.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I suppose, in a
  liberal and tolerant society, such a statement might seem odd.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But lots of people think like her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">You're not supposed to</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><b>Because I'm a
  priest.</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm an Episcopalian
  priest, however.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The word on the
  street is often a blank &quot;huh?&quot; when I say this, but individuals in
  the know make the comment that we are &quot;Catholic-lite,&quot; or
  &quot;liberal Catholics,&quot; or &quot;Catholics after a bong hit.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They know that private confession is optional.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I can get married.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  church has women priests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many of
  our clergy are in open, monogamous same-sex relationships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This is, of course, controversial, but this essay is about salsa
  dancing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like Catholics, however, we have the seven sacraments. We have
  monks and nuns and bishops and deacons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
  I &quot;say mass&quot; every Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>One woman asked me
  if I confess salsa as a sin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  don't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I love it, and I've never
  felt guilty for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><b>For me,
  dancing salsa is a gift.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
  gift I share with other dancers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
  when I go to a salsa social, it is almost like church for me - a blessed event
  for the purpose of celebrating joy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I enjoy the sensuality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  enjoy the presence of bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
  in the faith I inherit, a Body represents God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Confess about salsa?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  give thanks for salsa!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've been dancing
  for several years, but for the last two years I've been dancing for at least
  once a week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm at a level where
  I'm tolerated by some, and even enjoyed by others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I sometimes do double spins and syncopated shines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I know enough of the music to play with dancing occasionally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I love salsa, and I talk about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>And I have strange adventures on the dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Because, in part, I'm a priest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

  </font><br>
  </font>
  </b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nells is a
  nightclub that borders the West Village and Chelsea in Manhattan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>About ten years ago it had the cache' of Moomba or other currently hip
  clubs, but its velvety interior has been widely imitated and it lacks novelty
  value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's owned by the
  same people who own the restaurant Odeon, of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bright
  Lights Big City</i> fame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
  very 80's.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it needed
  something interesting to bridge into the Millenium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A couple years ago
  it started instituting a salsa night, with old style Cuban music on the ground
  floor, and contemporary salsa underneath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If you weren't a great dancer but wanted to hear excellent Cuban bands,
  you could stay on the first floor and drink El Presidente beer and ask whoever
  was at hand to dance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if you
  wanted to watch the most amazing dancers in the City, you went downstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A Venezualan woman, DJ Elvira, was - and is - the DJ there, and she
  plays only salsa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Good salsa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>This is important for Salseros to know because we are constantly
  worried that we'll be suddenly surprised by MerengueRock or a Techno Eastern
  European Cha-Cha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Elvira plays
  music for the dancers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
  dancers often follow her around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
  go to Le Belle Epoque, a place where the atmosphere makes the food taste
  better, when I know she'll be spinning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One evening at
  Nells, &quot;Gus,&quot; a Salsa maven often with a camera, announced to a
  Salsera with Attitude (an SWA), that I was a priest, &quot;un curita.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I understand why he told her - it's bizarre enough to create
  conversation where there might previously be none.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But this woman was non-plussed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Then
  why are you here?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Priests dont
  dance.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Obviously, I had interrupted her world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The church had invaded her home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I heard what she said:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I'm
  here to have fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't get in
  the way of that.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps she
  was worried the church would diminish the sensuality of her passion if it got
  too close to the Salsa scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;It's
  fun.&quot; I said, weakly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
  turned away. Gus just shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  went to find a partner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#000080">Another Evening<o:p></o:p>
  </font><br>
  </font>
  </b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wednesday evenings
  I often have diocesan meetings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  had been a long day and the meeting was finished at 9:30pm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>I could go to Nells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  dance floor would get busy by 10:00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But I was wearing
  my collar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Usually I don't
  wear my collar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I go
  dancing, I'm more interested in dancing than being an object of curiosity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I know that there are lots of excellent dancers who might not hold my
  religious sensibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
  usually before I go dancing I put on a little cologne, brush my teeth, wear
  clothes that salseros tend to wear, and remove the black suit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But tonight was different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
  I wanted to see, just once, what it would be like to &quot;witness,&quot;
  which is what priests call wearing a collar in a place that doesn't require
  it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A place like a dark nightclub in the West Village with lots
  of attractive women from, for example, the Dominican Republic, Japan and the
  Bronx.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to witness them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I wanted to witness them dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since I was not a
  great dancer I had discovered that sometimes I'd have better luck finding
  partners if I told them I was a priest, especially if they were better than
  me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm a novelty, and I decided
  that if I want to become a better dancer I could use my profession to my
  advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reader - don't get
  upset: I don't presume telling a young mambera &quot;I'm a priest&quot; is an
  invitation to my private palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
  I don't use it on anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have
  criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually, if I tell someone I'm a priest, it is to ask women
  who would not dance with me because 1) I'm not very good or 2) I don't look
  like Antonio Banderas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I am
  able to guess that they are willing to dance with a priest because 1) they've
  never danced with a priest before, 2) they have this sense that I'm not going
  to ask for their phone number and 3) they would feel guilty if they didn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I admit, there is some personality involved here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I'm really pretty harmless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's
  not really sexy to be harmless, but I definitely don't radiate the predatory
  vibes that emanate from many young men surrounded by women who move their
  hips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It helps to be polite
  and smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I decided to ask
  one tall young woman in a long, elegant, and tight black dress.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She looked me up and down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>She wanted, badly, to say &quot;no.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But she couldn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  was a priest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How do you say
  &quot;no&quot; to a priest?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It became clear
  that she was a beginner - a few lessons with <a href="../instructors/eddie_torres.htm"> Eddie
  Torres</a>, perhaps, but we
  didnt quite have the same timing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  could feel her hands tremble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">How do you shake your hips with a priest</i>? she must have been asking
  herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a good
  question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I'm not sure of the
  answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I was busy shaking
  mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I tried very hard to
  make her comfortable, but it was impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I don't think she exhaled until the dance was finished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>&quot;Thank you for dancing with me&quot; I said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>She smiled wanly and escaped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I have a
  collar on, I feel that I have permission to ask good dancers who seem trapped
  by their partner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I really don't
  like it when women (or men) act like their partner's property.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>By being a priest I decide to interrupt that kind of
  silliness. So I went up to one tall and generously built blonde with her
  boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked at him,
  then at me, and in a liberated leap, led me onto the dance floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Obviously she had been waiting to have one dance with someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The logic is that obviously I'm no threat to the boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I'm a priest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's
  probably not wise logic, however.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
  an Episcopalian.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whenever I saw her
  other Wednesday Evenings, I made a point of asking her to dance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She always said yes.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wearing a collar
  also carries some responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  figure it's polite and beneficial to ask people who don't get asked to dance
  much for some time on the floor also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  guess it is a kind of salsa charity, perhaps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I've benefited from salsa charity, myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Does this sound patronizing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  just love dancing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My friend Sunny, a
  very athletic and natural Korean dancer, often joins me when we go out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>She finds no disruption between her religiosity and her sensuality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But she was perplexed by my decision to wear a collar this one evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>As we were gathering our coats a young inebriated woman came up to me,
  man in tow by his neck-tie, and asked, <b> &quot;are you really a priest?&quot;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>&quot;Yes,&quot; I
  said.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;Will you
  bless me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm getting
  married.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;Of
  course,&quot; I said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
  worried she'd fall into me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I placed my hands
  on her head and said a few words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
  thanked me effusively. Sunny was quiet as
  I drove her home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally
  she said, &quot;you really shouldn't wear your collar dancing.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#000080">At a Festival in Harlem<o:p></o:p>
  </font><br>
  </font>
  </b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I went with two friends to the stickball festival in Spanish Harlem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I didnt have time to change into my civilian uniform, so I was stuck
  wearing my black suit and white clerical shirt on an incredibly hot day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We walked up and down 111<sup>th</sup> street, where I was overdressed
  and uncomfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I bought lemon
  ice to cool myself down, but the lemon ice turned out to be coconut, which
  isnt as refreshing to me as lemon or mango, but it was 75 cents, so whos
  complaining?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My friends wanted
  to get some crabcake  the best in the city, apparently  but the line was
  25 minutes long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>F. suggested I
  go dancing, so I did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I walked
  across the block and watched hundreds of people dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But I was feeling shy, so for a while I just danced by myself, a bit
  self conscious, trying to immerse myself in &quot;lloralas&quot; by Oscar
  DLeon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I noticed the woman
  next to me, wearing a white blouse and stretch pants, casually made up for
  public viewing, dancing with her friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>She had feathered hair, and the natural voluptuousness that comes from
  life and age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked her to
  dance, collar and all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She tilted
  her head, and agreed, although after her silent nod, yes, she never
  raised her eyes above the focus of my uniform, the white plastic that
  separates me from mortals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We danced three dances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  eased up at the end of each song, inviting her to pause and depart, but she
  remained lightly in my arms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each
  song gave us a bit more confidence as we tried more complicated turns and
  patterns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon she was doing slow
  double turns on the concrete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
  kept in time the entire dance, even when my blazer was flapping in the air as
  I turned. Whenever I looked at her she was looking at my shirt, keeping her
  eyes away from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would
  smile when I rustled my shoulders and kicked my feet, but she could not look
  above the collar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Right before we ended she buttoned up her blouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Until her hand had moved towards her chest, I hadnt noticed her
  flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had been so intent on
  looking at her eyes and watching the walking interruptions behind her that I
  didnt notice her blouse had slowly become undone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>She buttons up, says thank you, and moves towards her friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I see my friends on the sidewalk waving, but before I can reach them, a
  Cuban man stops me and says, Baila bien.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Baila bien. He holds out his hand and we do the wonder twins
  handshake, hitting our fists together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm hot and sweaty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I take
