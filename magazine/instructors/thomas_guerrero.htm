    by Many Siverio in 2000)<br>
    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana">
    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thomas Guererro is another Big Apple next generation
    Mambo instructor who teaches in Washington Heights. He is one of New York&#146;s three
    leading Dominican dance teachers and a founding member of <a href="#dance_company">The
    Santo Rico Dance Company</a>. As a dancer he has traveled around the country from
    coast-to-coast, up north to Canada and to Puerto Rico. He has performed at many of New
    York&#146;s and New Jersey&#146;s top Salsa/Mambo dance spots, not to mention at Congreso
    Mundial de la Salsa. He currently is the <a href="#dance_company">Director of the Santo
    Rico Dance Company</a>, taking over the reigns from his mentor Wilton Beltre.</font></p>
    <font size="2"><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thomas teaches his unique brand of mambo
    dancing at his own studio; The Santo Rico Dance School is located at 2403 
    2nd Avenue (between 123rd &amp; 124th Streets), 2<sup>nd</sup>
    floor, in Manhattan's Harlem. Upon visiting his <a href="#class">Saturday class</a>,
    I could tell that he is a no non-sense, direct, firm, shoot straight-from-the-hip type of
    guy. He is an instructor who communicates well and speaks his mind. He doesn&#146;t beat
    around the bush and gets straight to the point. His <a href="#class">classes</a> are
    taught in a bi-lingual format (English-Spanish). Counting is done in English while
    instructions are offered in both English and Spanish. He is assisted by two other
    instructors who help him divide the class into three different learning levels (beginner,
    intermediate and advance).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thomas usually begins his class with open floor shines
    (solo dancing). Each shine is reviewed one at a time. If a student is not familiar with a
    shine, he will pull the student to one side and break it down to them personally while the
    rest of the group continues to practice the same step to music. Many of Santo Rico&#146;s
    intermediate shines are complex and long. That&#146;s why Thomas breaks these down into
    segments (much like some instructors do with complex turn patterns). He&#146;ll move onto
    a new segment only when his group has been able to comprehend the previous one. These
    shines are tackled by thoroughly breaking them down to the count of the clave first, then
    performed to a slow tune and finally to a faster song. The number of shines covered in
    class depend on how quickly students are absorbing material on that day. Thomas usually
    doesn&#146;t like to move on until everyone in his group understands every step covered by
    him so far.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whenever possible pointers are provided to help enhance a
    student&#146;s styling or corrections are made to help avoid accidents when dancing.
    Concepts are reviewed and drilled into students like Thomas&#146;s 4 rules of dancing
    (1.Head up; 2. Shoulders move to music &amp; tempo; 3. Knees bent &amp; 4. Weight on Ball
    of foot). The four items together result in balance when dancing</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second half of the class focuses on partner dancing.
    Thomas, like his two other Dominican counterparts, is known for his innovative turn
    patterns. I&#146;ve nicknamed him the &quot;Spin-miester&quot; because of the routine he
    choreographed for Santo Rico during the 1999 Congreso Mundial de la Salsa in Puerto Rico
    (which was a non-stop performance of complex turn patterns and spins). His partnering
    style consists of multiple turns, spins &amp; counter-turns for both men and women. Thomas
    usually leads by counting out loud. He drills the hell out of a turn pattern to make sure
    that students get it. Each pattern is demonstrated, verbally broken down and then
    practiced to music. He&#146;ll offer valuable partnering tips on styling, balance and
    footwork with emphasis on safety (i.e. elbow placement so not to hit the girl during a
    turn pattern). After a pattern has been absorbed, Thomas will ask couples to execute the
    sequence one at a time. This is when he&#146;ll catch individual mistakes and make
    additional corrections. At the end, the group is left to practice to music on their own,
    while Thomas supervises.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thomas's Style in a nutshell:<br>
    </font></b><i><font face="Verdana" color="#008000" size="2">If I were to describe Thomas
    Guerrero&#146;s style of dancing mambo to other instructors, I would say he has a very
    energetic Dominican Street Style of dancing. He is a human metaphor of multiple turns,
    spins, turn combos, counter turns and sudden stops with change of directions. He has a
    very strong and aggressive lead. Many women become multiple spinning experts under his
    style of mambo dancing out of sheer necessity and practice. So if your looking for
    interesting turn patterns and got energy to burn on the dance floor then Thomas Guerrero
    may be the instructor for you.</font></i></p>

Verdana">The art of teaching mambo dancing has grown significantly within the
    last couple of years. If you have any doubts just look at our instructor
    directory homepage. From a mere few instructors teaching the art in the
    mid-1990s the list has grown to over 50 names in 2002. Yet from this
    list, several of these instructors have managed to surpassed the rest of the
    pack because they become known for something. Well it just so happens
    that Thomas Guerrero (Head Instructor of the Santo Rico Dance Studio &amp;
    Director of the Santo Rico Dance Company) is one of those instructors. Since
    taking over the Santo Rico Dance Studio in the late 90s, Thomas has
    developed a well deserved reputation for partnerwork. With this in mind,
    Ill say that Thomass Saturday Partnerwork Class is NYs <b><font color="#FF0000">least</font></b>
    known resource. Take it from me, as someone whos been to a good number of
    classes and none of them compare to a typical Thomas partnerwork class. <b>Pound
    for pound, I would say that he offers the most challenging; exciting,
    innovative and creative turn pattern class currently available in NYC.</b>
    With the assistance of two other qualified instructors, he breaks up his
    class into beginner, intermediate and advance. Students can expect to go
    through a whirlwind of mini-turns, spins, stops, counter-stops hand-checks,
    and whips, which eventually evolve into one heck of a monster marathon, turn
    pattern. Its for this reason that Ive nicknamed Thomas as the
    Spinmiester of NY Mambo. In just a few years his dance studio has
    cranked out many top level NY dancers. The Santo Rico men are known for
    being effectively strong leaders, while the women have developed a
    reputation for being dance floor Spinning Queens. Its for this
    reason that SalsaNewYork Magazine has given Thomas Guerreros Saturday
    Partnerwork Class the title of <b><font color="#FF0000">BEST PARTNERWORK
    CLASS IN NYC.</font></b></span></p>

THE HISTORY OF THE SANTO RICO DANCE COMPANY</big></em></big></font><br>
<small>by Thomas Guerrero<br>
<br>
Santo Rico is a dance company performing primarily Mambo dancing, which has <br>
become a way of life in Latin communities like Washington Heights, the Bronx <br>
and other communities throughout the City of New York.&nbsp; The history of Santo <br>
Rico dates back to 1995.&nbsp; The name of the dance company is derived from the <br>
initial members of the group being half from Santo Domingo <br>
[(Santo) and half from Puerto Rico (Rico), hence the <br>
name &quot;Santo Rico.<br>
<br>
The primary purpose in forming Santo Rico was to make a difference in the <br>
community by promoting a pro-life attitude in helping kids to stay off drugs <br>
and off the streets by instilling discipline within them and pointing them <br>
in the right direction while teaching them the art of dancing Mambo.&nbsp; Santo <br>
Rico's current purpose continues to be to serve the community, and through <br>
the years has become stronger because of a well-kept, respectable reputation <br>
that has helped establish a stronger following from within the younger and <br>
older generations.<br>
<br>
Santo Rico was initially formed by Wilton Beltre, a 32 year old Dominican <br>
native, who expressed his love for dancing by displaying his street style of <br>
dancing Mambo/Salsa in local nightclubs in New York City.&nbsp; Prior to forming <br>
Santo Rico, Wilton received dancing instruction from the well renowned Eddie <br>
Torres.&nbsp; This gave him professionalism and grace and ultimately led to the <br>
development of a unique style.&nbsp; During his stint with Mr. Torres Wilton <br>
excelled and brought his dancing ability to such a high level that he became <br>
one of the most outstanding members of The Eddie Torres Dance Company, which <br>
led to his traveling abroad with Eddie Torres' dance company and performing <br>
in England.<br>
<br>
After several years with Eddie, Wilton proceeded to go solo and form his own <br>
group, Santo Rico Dance Co.&nbsp; Wilton incorporated his clean, swift, technical <br>
style of dancing into that of an already very talented group of dancers who <br>
also began with a street oriented style of dancing.&nbsp; He then added another <br>
core of professional dancers to add more diversity to the group.&nbsp; This <br>
endeavor was met with negativity because no one thought it was going to be <br>
possible to manage and/or handle this new core of talented and experienced <br>
dancers, who held their own so well.&nbsp; However, Wilton took this core of <br>
&quot;dream teamers&quot; and successfully blended them in with the already <br>
disciplined and talented members of Santo Rico and also succeeded in further <br>
improving their abilities.&nbsp; He managed to instill his technical style into <br>
their respective styles of dancing and added more moves (e.g., steps and <br>
turns) to their respective repertoires.&nbsp; Wilton promoted Santo Rico by <br>
performing in many high profile events including Gozamba 96 - a Latin <br>
festival which was alternately held that year in Riverbank State Park in <br>
Washington Heights and one year at Randall's Island.<br>
<br>
Wilton was an intimidating figure, hard to figure out; his disposition <br>
dictated a demand for respect and discipline - no more, no less!&nbsp; However, <br>
his strict demeanor helped the members of the group become, not only better <br>
dancers, but also better people.&nbsp; It gave them a sense of direction and <br>
determination in attempting to get to his level at some point of their <br>
dancing careers.&nbsp; He challenged them with his best and never let them forget <br>
that:&nbsp; (1) &quot;almost isn't good enough,&quot; (2) &quot;always practice as if you're <br>
performing&quot; and (3) &quot;You only have one chance to impress and do it right at <br>
a performance.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Wilton started the dance company he taught and held the group's <br>
rehearsals on the second floor of a restaurant called &quot;La Pequeña España&quot; - <br>
[Ital]&quot;Pequeña&quot;[Ital] meaning very small in Spanish and indeed the space was <br>
[Ital]pequeña[Ital].&nbsp; There were many difficulties he had to surmount, for <br>
obvious reasons: (1) The dance company didn't have a place of its own and <br>
therefore its members had to submit to the schedules and rules and <br>
regulations of people who didn't understand its purpose and its art; (2) the <br>
business environment was unstable, making it difficult to establish a strong <br>
and sturdy foundation at the time; (3) the attempt to maintain a consistency <br>
with the students in the new dance company, but Wilton was not discouraged.&nbsp; <br>
At times, he would take most of his students on some Sundays to Jones Beach <br>
and give them classes out there perhaps either because his Sunday class <br>
schedule conflicted with that of the person he was subletting from, or it <br>
was probably too hot due to the lack of air conditioning in some of the <br>
places in which he taught.&nbsp; By this time, Wilton's classes were growing at a <br>
rapid rate as his clientele grew stronger.&nbsp; Once people found out about <br>
Wilton's dance school and how others were already getting so good at the art <br>
via his teaching methods they would flock into Wilton's classes wanting to <br>
know how to dance, and right before our eyes Wilton's school established <br>
itself as one of the best Salsa schools among the Dominican community.<br>
<br>
One of the turning points for Santo Rico came when Wilton acquired rehearsal <br>
space through a friend (and now one of the instructors of the Santo Rico <br>
Dance School) by the name of Victor &quot;Moreno&quot; Mayovanex.&nbsp; Moreno had been <br>
helping Wilton shop around for a bigger place until one day he approached <br>
Wilton and rushed him to go see a place down the block from La Pequeña <br>
España that wasn't doing too well financially, which the owners were <br>
intending to get rid of.&nbsp; This was Wilton's big break because they sold the <br>
place to him at an incredibly low price and in pretty good condition.&nbsp; <br>
Wilton immediately took advantage of this opportunity and in his short time <br>
teaching he had his own school, with his own schedule and the chance to <br>
build an even stronger foundation from his aspirations.&nbsp; Santo Rico Dance <br>
School was up and running.&nbsp; There was more rehearsal time and more rehearsal <br>
space thanks to Moreno's determination and his vision in helping Wilton <br>
search for a new place.<br>
<br>
Another turning point for Santo Rico was the first time it performed on <br>
Channel 41, the Latin community's most popular channel.&nbsp; It performed on a <br>
program called &quot;Sabado al Medio Dia.&quot;&nbsp; This performance signaled the <br>
beginning of something special because it drew an even larger following of <br>
students and increased Santo Rico's popularity among other communities.&nbsp; <br>
Several promoters and organizations, including Channel 41, grew interested <br>
in the group.&nbsp; This is when Santo Rico really established itself as a solid <br>
dance troop.&nbsp; For example, Channel 41 put them in some of their commercials, <br>
and from this a lot of other performances and opportunities arose.&nbsp; Their <br>
visions grew and their dreams were becoming reality before their very eyes.&nbsp; <br>
In fact, thereafter they were invited to audition for a fundraiser at a club <br>
located in downtown Manhattan called &quot;Roxy&quot; that was to be hosted by Michael <br>
DeLorenzo and Lauren Velez of Fox 5's &quot;New York Undercover,&quot; which was one <br>
of the hottest shows on TV at the time.&nbsp; Santo Rico was also invited to <br>
perform in Madison Square Garden.&nbsp; At the first annual World Salsa Congress <br>
in Puerto Rico they were also invited to perform one of the hottest routines <br>
out at the time, a number called &quot;Soneros de Bailadores,&quot; choreographed by <br>
Wilton Beltre.&nbsp; It was this routine that actually put Santo Rico on the <br>
dancing map. At this point and because of this routine, Wilton Beltre and <br>
Santo Rico Dance Co. were rolling and only getting better with every <br>
performance.<br>
<br>
Soneros de Bailadores was a dynamic, well-choreographed routine <br>
that included all aspects of dancing Mambo.&nbsp; It included an array of complex <br>
footwork for both the men and the women, beautiful styling, intricate turn <br>
patterns and a jamboree.&nbsp; The song was eight minutes and fifteen seconds <br>
long and the gracefulness and energy with which it was performed was <br>
exciting to watch.&nbsp; At the time, most people who saw this routine loved it <br>
and wanted to learn it because of its complexity and beauty.&nbsp; Some have gone <br>
as far as saying that Soneros de Bailadores is a classic because it has been <br>
performed so many times by so many different people, even after Wilton's <br>
departure.<br>
<br>
After all the short-term success and after beginning to get all the exposure <br>
that helped sky- rocket the professional dancing careers of the members of <br>
Santo Rico, things started to roll downhill for the company.&nbsp; In 1997 Wilton <br>
was forced to relinquish the group due to personal matters he had to attend <br>
to.&nbsp; At that point, the group had no direction without Wilton's leadership <br>
and experience.&nbsp; Due to the lack of supervision and to this misfortune, the <br>
group began to experience things like identity problems, power struggles, <br>
mistrust, lack of enthusiasm and motivation and an overall array of general <br>
problems that plagues a team when their coach or leader isn't available to <br>
maintain usual control and/or restore order.&nbsp; However, upon Wilton's <br>
departure they all felt inclined to try and pick up the slack from his <br>
absence, which they did for a while, but then it got to be too much for most <br>
of them and it became harder and harder and even frustrating to manage at <br>
times.&nbsp; The reality of Wilton's unexpected leave of absence basically left <br>
the group unprepared to deal with the daily grind of managing and directing <br>
the group's affairs on a full-time basis.&nbsp; It became very difficult due to <br>
the fact that none of them had the time nor could elicit the effort required <br>
to maintain the necessary consistency in order to keep the company running <br>
at the level that it was.&nbsp; Ultimately, the members of the company went their <br>
separate ways, some did their own thing on a part-time basis with their <br>
dancing like teaching and/or starting their own groups.<br>
<br>
During his time with the group Wilton had become very close with one of the <br>
group's original members by the name of Thomas Guerrero and throughout their <br>
time together established a very close knit relationship filled with trust <br>
and a friendship beyond dancing.&nbsp; Upon his departure Wilton entrusted Thomas <br>
with the company's responsibilities.&nbsp; At the time, this was an incredibly <br>
challenging feat for Thomas because of his lack of experience and know-how <br>
as far as handling a business or maintaining a professional dance school.&nbsp; <br>
However, Thomas felt determined to persevere because of his commitment to <br>
their friendship and therefore didn't want to desert Wilton at such a time <br>
of need.&nbsp; Wilton pleaded with him to not let all get lost in the crossfire <br>
of everything that had hit their company; the break-up of the team, his <br>
departure, the expenses of the school and most importantly the reputation of <br>
the name.&nbsp; Wilton also pleaded with Thomas to not let the Santo Rico name <br>
vanish or be taken away, and vowed to someday return, which led Thomas to <br>
proceed with devoting himself to Santo Rico and its endeavors.&nbsp; He began to <br>
formally give classes at Wilton's school alongside others who helped out for <br>
Wilton's sake.&nbsp; At first, Thomas figured that teaching wouldn't be that big <br>
of a deal and that he wouldn't have a hard time getting the hang of it <br>
because he already knew how to dance.&nbsp; However, as time progressed it became <br>
incredibly difficult as he realized that he had to do a lot of learning of <br>
his own in order to acclimate himself to the teaching environment.&nbsp; Thomas <br>
felt obligated to further educate himself in dancing, so he did some <br>
research and studied the techniques and fundamentals of Mambo, which helped <br>
a great deal because it helped him understand the art and its history a lot <br>
better.&nbsp; It made Thomas realize many things he didn't know that perhaps <br>
would have helped him with his dancing in the past.<br>
<br>
Upon educating himself, he also began to really enjoy teaching and decided <br>
to take it a step further, so he contacted two of Wilton's closest friends, <br>
Elvin Santos and Moreno to help him teach and maintain the school.&nbsp; Elvin <br>
and Moreno concurred with Thomas' plan to solidify the school's reputation, <br>
and to begin with, worked very hard toward trying to establish themselves as <br>
good instructors and toward reclaiming Wilton's renown.&nbsp; After approximately <br>
a year they established a good clientele and the people in the community <br>
began to familiarize and associate themselves with the name Santo Rico <br>
again, also due in part to the exceptional reputation that Wilton had <br>
established.<br>
<br>
It was like starting all over again; the guys proceeded to amend the initial <br>
registration papers of the company because Wilton could no longer be the <br>
primary contact for the organization and they became the proprietors of <br>
Santo Rico; Thomas became President and Moreno and Elvin became Vice <br>
Presidents.&nbsp; The process of becoming fully responsible for the school and <br>
associating themselves with the business aspect of the company was a <br>
challenge in itself because it taught them more about the business, thanks <br>
to their representative Francisco Rosario, who with his hard work and <br>
knowledge, helped make this process smoother.<br>
<br>
Francisco helped them to finally fully register and incorporate the name <br>
&quot;Santo Rico&quot;, and to move further along with the company's future plans. &nbsp; He
<br>
also advised them on trademarking the name as well and handled most of the <br>
legal work for them.&nbsp; Francisco's contributions were also a result of the <br>
fact that he had developed a very good working relationship with Wilton and <br>
fortunately for Thomas, Elvin and Moreno, they had someone as hard working <br>
as he that was willing to diligently work toward handling most of the <br>
school's business affairs, despite some of the school's downfalls.<br>
<br>
After Moreno, Elvin and Thomas took full responsibility of the company they <br>
began doing small performances of old routines that Wilton had choreographed <br>
because of their lack of experience in choreographing in order to start <br>
promoting the name Santo Rico.&nbsp; They performed at small clubs in New Jersey <br>
and New York and tried to make a name of themselves now that they were <br>
starting anew.&nbsp; They performed for a short time only because the school <br>
suddenly needed their attention more than ever because their clientele was <br>
diminishing.&nbsp; Thereafter, most of their time was consumed with trying to <br>
restore the school's clientele by promoting and maintaining the school.&nbsp; The <br>
class schedules changed due to the decline in students so Moreno and Elvin <br>
would teach most of the time while Thomas would try to handle other aspects <br>
of the school, like paperwork and the coordination of student activities and <br>
groups.&nbsp; After a short while and because the school was sort of back on its <br>
feet, Thomas decided to take a rest from the dancing world, so he took a few <br>
months off.<br>
<br>
During his time off Thomas occasionally visited with the guys at the school <br>
and once in a while went social dancing to not lose his step entirely.&nbsp; <br>
After a few months of relaxation Thomas realized how much he missed the <br>
dancing world and decided to go back to teaching, so he decided to open his <br>
own dance school to later name it Santo Rico II.&nbsp; Upon inaugurating Santo <br>
Rico II Thomas established a strong clientele and a decent reputation as an <br>
instructor.&nbsp; After a few months of teaching he proceeded to put together a <br>
student group from both Santo Rico I (Wilton's original school) and II and <br>
named it &quot;Xibicion&quot; Santo Rico - [Ital]&quot;Xibicion&quot;[Ital] meaning &quot;Exhibition&quot; <br>
in Spanish.&nbsp; Xibicion Santo Rico was Thomas' personal project and his pride <br>
and joy.&nbsp; This group of students had exceptional talent and the utmost <br>
dedication and love for dancing.&nbsp; Most of them lived outside the city: <br>
Queens, New Jersey and even Yonkers, which made it hard for them to attend <br>
Thomas' rehearsals in Manhattan, but because of their dedication, <br>
determination and the will to learn and succeed, distance was never a factor <br>
for them.&nbsp; Xibicion excelled at an extremely rapid rate not only because of <br>
their talent but because they enjoyed the challenge that Thomas presented <br>
them with.&nbsp; Their first routine was a routine that he thought would never be <br>
finished due to its level of difficulty, but through his faith and the love <br>
he developed for them Thomas relentlessly worked toward helping them finish <br>
this particular routine.&nbsp; This officially marked the beginning of Thomas' <br>
career as a choreographer and a director of a group.&nbsp; Thereafter, due to <br>
Xibicion's success and talent, he proceeded to promote Xibicion by including <br>
them in performances at different clubs and even on TV to help further raise <br>
Santo Rico's stock... and raise it they did!&nbsp;&nbsp; People couldn't believe that <br>
this group was actually a student group because of how poised and graceful <br>
they were on stage.&nbsp; Their first TV stint was in the Diamante Show on Public <br>
Access Television, thanks to Roberto and Rosa Valentin, the coordinators of <br>
the show.&nbsp; Roberto took one look at them and was so impressed with their <br>
performance that he personally invited them on the show for a second time to <br>
perform their second routine.&nbsp; This promotion helped because it further <br>
greatly increased Santo Rico's stock and its clientele.&nbsp; Upon watching <br>
Xibicion perform on the Diamante Show, the people were ringing the phones <br>
off the hook for information about their dance school.<br>
<br>
Upon Thomas' completion of the Xibicion project: completing their routines, <br>
putting them on stage and giving them the necessary exposure to once again <br>
make a name of Santo Rico's Dance Schools, he continued to get together with <br>
the kids (&quot;Xibicion&quot;) on a weekly basis and presented them with challenges <br>
unparalleled with anything they ever experienced, especially from an <br>
entertainment's perspective.&nbsp; Working with Xibicion was a challenge in <br>
itself for Thomas because, while on the one hand he had to deal with the <br>
student's inexperience and teach them how to show respect for the art by <br>
demonstrating discipline and poise on stage and off, on the other hand they <br>
were excelling at such a rapid rate that he had to continually come up with <br>
ideas to keep them interested and on their toes.&nbsp; Through his experience and <br>
creativity Thomas was successful in pulling this off, however, with the <br>
result that the students' dancing abilities were enhanced and their level of <br>
maturity soared.&nbsp; Fortunately for Thomas, Xibicion was a loyal group who <br>
always worked hard for him in spite of there being other opportunities <br>
available, like dancing for other groups with more longevity who could <br>
perhaps offer a little more than what Santo Rico could at the time.&nbsp; The <br>
members of Xibicion also meshed incredibly well not only with Thomas, but <br>
with each other, which is sometimes difficult to do in this business because <br>
of all the bickering and the negative energy that's generated among many <br>
dancers.&nbsp; For the most part, Xibicion's motivation came from the chemistry <br>
that existed among them, which helped them support each other even when the <br>
going got tough.&nbsp; They got along extremely well and maintained harmony and <br>
togetherness despite taking on new challenges that at times even frustrated <br>
them.&nbsp; This absolutely impressed Thomas, so he felt inclined to reward them <br>
for their maturity as dancers and as people; therefore, due to Xibicion's <br>
success and rapid progress Thomas decided that they were ready for the &quot;big <br>
dance,&quot; so he made the members of Xibicion Santo Rico a part of his actual <br>
professional dance company &quot;The New Santo Rico.&quot;<br>
<br>
One day Thomas received a special visit from Moreno, who was still handling <br>
Santo Rico I.&nbsp; Moreno was very in touch with Thomas' accomplishments in <br>
Santo Rico II.&nbsp; He sympathized with Thomas' belief to persevere in taking <br>
dancing in Santo Rico to another level; therefore he supported Thomas <br>
throughout by helping him in such things as choreographing Xibicion's <br>
routines and in handling the student's different characteristics and <br>
personalities.&nbsp; Moreno's presence contributed to helping the group cope <br>
whenever the intensity became a bit much with his high-spirited, yet <br>
composed attitude.&nbsp; He helped them maintain composure and even get a laugh <br>
out of them and even out of Thomas every now and again, despite his being <br>
such a disciplinarian.&nbsp; Moreno's visit was to inform Thomas of Elvin's <br>
departure from Santo Rico I due to personal reasons and he asked for Thomas' <br>
help to run Santo Rico I upon Elvin's departure, which now belonged to them <br>
solely thanks to Wilton.&nbsp; Thomas seized the opportunity because this would <br>
alleviate the problem of the high rent he was paying for Santo Rico II, so <br>
he obliged and returned to Santo Rico I.<br>
<br>
Everything worked out wonderfully with Thomas' classes upon the merger of <br>
the two schools.&nbsp; Thomas was able to keep a very similar teaching schedule <br>
to that of Santo Rico II; his students handled the change of address and the <br>
change of ambience extremely well and the dance group were really supportive <br>
and stood focused and motivated throughout this transition. On Thomas' first <br>
day back to the original Santo Rico, a total of thirty-seven students turned <br>
out for his first class.&nbsp; This overwhelming turn out consisted of students <br>
from both Santo Rico I and II who filled the studio to capacity.&nbsp; This was <br>
also a sign of something special because it illustrated the group's <br>
popularity and recognition for Santo Rico.<br>
<br>
Today, Santo Rico Dance Co. is a certified dance corporation registered with <br>
the State of New York.&nbsp; Santo Rico Dance School is currently well <br>
established with a formidable clientele.&nbsp; Santo Rico's curriculum entails <br>
teaching on a daily basis and the recruitment of students with the potential <br>
and the will to someday perform, the way Xibicion was recruited, for <br>
example.&nbsp; Santo Rico's professional dance troop, &quot;The New Santo Rico,&quot; <br>
currently consists of eleven (11) dancers, six (6) males and five (5) <br>
females, most of whom were members of Xibicion Santo Rico in addition to <br>
Thomas, Moreno and Amaryllis Cintron, the most experienced dancers of their <br>
professional company.&nbsp; The New Santo Rico considers themselves the babies of <br>
the industry because: (1) their new beginning due to their history has <br>
basically led them to start from scratch; (2) Thomas and Moreno's handling <br>
of the group's affairs (like performing and putting together different <br>
marketing strategies to promote the group) is coming together now because of <br>
their newfound stability; and (3) because they have such a young, <br>
inexperienced group who still have a lot to learn about the industry, but <br>
are confident Santo Rico will do well due to their desire and determination <br>
to succeed.<br>
<br>
With God's help, the New Santo Rico's goals are to prepare themselves well <br>
for future endeavors.&nbsp; Santo Rico also intends to travel to different places <br>
to entertain where their style and their dance company has not yet been <br>
introduced, and doing so in a fashionable and favorable manner; exhibiting <br>
respect and professionalism in order to promote themselves as positive <br>
contributors in different aspects of the art.<br>
