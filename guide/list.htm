<p><font face="Arial"><b>1.&nbsp; <u>Charge For Listing Events</u> -</b>&nbsp; 
Between 2000 and 3000 dancers (&quot;unique viewers&quot;) look at this site every single 
day.&nbsp; When an event is posted on our site, a lot of people see it.&nbsp; We are a 
free public service web site for the On 2 mambo dancers, so 
we do not charge money for listings.&nbsp; However, as &quot;payment&quot; for our listing 
an event, we ask that all flyers, emails, FaceBook or other social media 
listings, and other promotional materials distributed by the promoters for that 
event, have our web site clearly written as follows:&nbsp; www.SalsaNewYork.com (with the S, N and Y capitalized), or use our logo (sized 
big enough so it is clearly legible).&nbsp; Our logo is at the top of this page.&nbsp; 
Also, we ask that several announcements made during the event  mention
<a href="http://www.SalsaNewYork.com">www.SalsaNewYork.com</a> .&nbsp; And, of 
course, if we come to the event, we would like to be on the guest list for 2 
people.&nbsp; When you consider how many dancers are looking at this site every 
day, we believe this is a fair trade.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">2</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.&nbsp; <u>We Only List Certain Salsa Dancing Events</u>&nbsp; - </b>&nbsp;Please 
look at what it says at the top of this and every page of this web site:&nbsp; 
<u>&quot;SalsaNewYork.com:&nbsp; A Web Site About New York Style Mambo Dancing &quot;Breaking 
On 2&quot;</u>.&nbsp; This is not a general salsa web site, or a general Latin 
entertainment web site, or a web site about Latin music or Latin culture, 
history or Latin jazz.&nbsp; <i><b>This is a dancer's web site only.</b></i>&nbsp; More 
specifically, it is for a very distinct group of social dancers who use a certain 
timing and style:&nbsp; <i><b>they dance mambo &quot;New York style breaking On 2&quot;, 
sometimes called &quot;Eddie Torres style&quot;.</b></i>&nbsp; 
And that is all we are concerned with and all we focus on.&nbsp; See our
<a href="description_newsletter.htm">Welcome &amp; Description</a> of this web site, 
and see our <a href="../ourdancemusic.htm#DEFINITION">Definition of Dancing On 2</a>.&nbsp; 
Every month, thousands of separate individual dancers come to this web site 
to read our information and to decide where to go out dancing &quot;On 2&quot;.&nbsp; Out of the 
hundreds of Latin events going on in the New York metropolitan area, we only 
list a few, the ones which will appeal to these mainstream &quot;On 2&quot; mambo 
social dancers.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">3</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.</b> <b>&nbsp;<u>We Mainly List Events Within New 
York City</u> -</b>&nbsp; We almost never list events outside of the 5 
boroughs of New York City.&nbsp; The reason is that we are just 2 guys doing 
this non-commercial web site in our spare time, and at our own expense, and we 
have to check each event out personally and also have to know, or get to know, 
the people putting on the event so we can be sure of the music and the setting 
and whether it would be pleasing to our &quot;On 2&quot; viewers.&nbsp; It is almost 
impossible for us to personally visit and monitor events outside of the City.&nbsp; 
Of those very few events listed on our calendar which are not in New York City, 
they are not too far away and they are put on by people who we know personally 
because they socialize in the &quot;On 2&quot; community within New York City.&nbsp; We are sorry but our time and resources are very limited.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If we do not know you personally from within the NYC &quot;On 
2&quot; mambo scene, then we cannot consider listing your event until it has been 
running for at least several months or a year or more, and it has been promoted at the &quot;On 2&quot; 
mambo events, and it has already attracted a crowd of mainstream &quot;On 2&quot; dancers who we can 
get feedback from.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We don't list events on boats or ships.&nbsp; We don't 
list dance competitions, dance performances (unless they occur in a social 
dancing setting) or salsa concerts in a stadium or theater.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">4</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.</b>&nbsp; <b><u>We 
Mainly List Events Only Put On By People We 
Know Personally From The NYC &quot;On 2&quot; Community</u> - </b>&nbsp;Since we are focused on 
social dance events for this narrow niche 
group of &quot;On 2&quot; dancers, we can only list quickly an event being run by someone, 
or DJd by someone, we know well personally because we know of their &quot;On 2&quot; commitment 
and we've been to their events before.&nbsp; When new events come along put on 
by, or DJd by, someone who we are not personally familiar with, we then wait 
before listing that event until we see that it is appropriate for the mainstream &quot;On 2&quot; 
dancers and we see that those producing the event are out there promoting at the 
&quot;On 2&quot; places.&nbsp; <u>We would also not list quickly any event put on 
by someone we know who never put on an event before that we've attended</u>, or who 
put on a previous event we attended which wasn't good for the On 2 dancers.&nbsp; 
We can only list an event when it is put on by someone we can be comfortable 
with and we have a good relationship with.&nbsp;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If an event is put on by a dance studio, we will only list 
its event if that studio teaches the standard &quot;New York On 2 / Eddie Torres 
Style&quot; <u>exclusively</u>.&nbsp; If a studio teaches different timings and styles of 
dancing to salsa, we won't list their events.&nbsp; This is our way of promoting 
the NY On 2 style.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">We are not a promotional site, we don't help events become 
more successful.&nbsp; We wait until the event creates popularity with the 
mainstream &quot;On 
2&quot; social dancing crowd and only then do we list it on our calendar.&nbsp; Our calendar is a 
guide for the &quot;On 2&quot; <u>social dancers</u>, not a promotional tool for <u>events</u>.</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Since keeping our information accurate and up-to-date is 
our first priority, we must have open and quick communication available by phone 
(voice) and email with those putting on events listed on our site.&nbsp; At 
times of possible changes in an event, or a cancellation (for example, due to 
weather), promoters must tell us as early as possible so that we can let our 
viewers know of the changes.&nbsp; And if we call or email promoters about their 
events, they must be able to respond very promptly.&nbsp; Without that kind of 
quick communication, we will not list an event, or we will remove one that is 
already listed.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">5</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.&nbsp; <u>We List Events That Have Good &quot;On 2&quot; Attendance</u>&nbsp; 
- </b>&nbsp;Our viewers go to events listed on our calendar in order to dance 
with many On 2 partners.&nbsp; They range from beginner to advanced &quot;On 2&quot; dancers.&nbsp; 
That means that any event listed on our calendar must have a lot of &quot;On 2&quot; people there, 
and there must be a range of dancers at different skill levels.&nbsp; Who ever 
puts on an event must build up the attendance of &quot;On 2&quot; dancers through 
their own promotion with flyers at 
our various &quot;On 2&quot; events, email promotion, internet and word of mouth.&nbsp; 
<u><b><font color="#FF0000">We cannot 
list an event which has not yet built up a good crowd of mainstream &quot;On 2&quot; regulars</font></b>
</u>because 
our viewers would not have enough &quot;On 2&quot; partners to dance with.&nbsp; We are 
not promoters.&nbsp; We serve the <u>dancers</u> who are looking for good 
events, not the <u>promoters</u>.&nbsp; <u>We wait until an event is 
consistently well attended 
by &quot;On 2&quot; dancers before we consider listing it on our calendar.</u>&nbsp; Very often, we wait until 
we know people personally who have been going to an event and give it a good 
recommendation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If an event is given in a dance studio, dance hall, 
community center, gym or similar venue, we wouldn't list it unless a <u>very 
large majority</u>, at least 80% or more, are dancing exclusively On 2, and 
there is an approximate 50% - 50% balance of women and men On 2 partners 
available so everyone will have someone to dance with.&nbsp; In other words, it 
is truly a mainstream On 2 event.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If an event is given in a general night club, or is one of 
the many summer outdoor salsa events in a New York park or on a pier, we are 
less insistent on a high percentage of On 2 dancers there when we consider 
listing it.&nbsp; But always, we ask the question:&nbsp; &quot;If an On 2 dancer goes 
to such an event, because they saw it listed on our calendar, will they find the 
right music and On 2 partners in order to have a good time?&quot;&nbsp; That is the 
service our calendar is offering.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">6</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.&nbsp; <u>A Certain Kind Of Salsa Music</u>&nbsp; -</b>&nbsp; This 
group of &quot;On 2&quot; dancers prefers a certain kind of music which we loosely label 
&quot;classic salsa&quot;.&nbsp; Classic salsa has a certain rhythm structure that works 
best with the timing that we use in our dance.&nbsp; Good examples would be the 
music of El Gran Combo, Tito Puente, Raulin Rosendo, Willie Rosario, and certain 
songs by Eddie Palmieri, Azabache, Angel Canales, Frankie Ruiz, Erick, Ismael 
Rivera, Jose Alberto, Africando, Celia Cruz, Grupo Niche, Tito Rodriguez, Hector 
Lavoe, Oscar D'Leon, Ray Barretto and many others.&nbsp; 
See our <a href="song_list.htm#SONGS">List of Classic Salsa Dance Songs</a>.&nbsp; 
 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These dancers do not generally like to dance to what is called &quot;Latin jazz&quot;, 
&quot;Cuban music&quot;, nor most of the salsa heard on pop Latin radio stations such as <a href="http://www.lamega.com/">
La Mega 97.9 FM</a>, salsa which is referred 
to as &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;salsa romantica&quot;.&nbsp; To give a better idea of the 
style of music we do not like to dance to, with a few exceptions most of the 
songs of the following singers &amp; bands would fall into this category:&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Brenda Starr, Luis Damon, DLG, Alex D'Castro, 
Adolescents Orchestra, Tito Nieves, Nino Segarra, some Miles Pena and Tony Vega, Jerry 
Rivera, Victor Manuelle, Michael Stuart, some Isidro Infante, La India, Johnny Rivera, 
Tito Rojas, Mark Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, some Gilberto Santa Rosa, Gloria Estefan, 
Giro, Luis Enrique, Rey Ruiz, Domingo Quinones, Eddie Santiago, Frankie Negron, 
Puerto Rican Power, Cano Estremera and others of this style.</font></p>

</blockquote>

</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">7</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.&nbsp; <u>How This Music Should Be Played</u>&nbsp; -</b>&nbsp; And 
this group of dancers prefers to hear almost entirely classic salsa music played 
all night long, with maybe an occasional cha cha.&nbsp; Also, an occasional 
merengue or bachata is tolerated, maybe 1 or 2 per hour, but little or no English music 
should be played such as house, hip hop, reggae, R &amp; B, disco, Reggaeton or rave.&nbsp; 
 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><i><b>The 
event should be providing classic salsa dance music for 75% of <u>every hour</u> for 
the whole event.&nbsp; That means salsa for 45 
minutes per hour, with no break in the salsa music for longer than 15 minutes 
per hour, and then returning again to salsa for at least  another straight 15 
minutes or longer.&nbsp; The salsa does not have to be played for 45 minutes 
straight, but there has to be a total of 45 minutes of salsa played during every 
hour for the whole event.&nbsp; If an event does not play this much salsa, it will not be 
considered for posting 
on our main calendar.</b></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If 
a DJ is playing the music, these dancers want the music played as it was 
recorded by the artist from beginning to end, without any DJ distortions or 
manipulations such as 
&quot;looping&quot; and &quot;mixing&quot;.&nbsp; See our <a href="song_list.htm">Guidelines For DJs</a>.&nbsp; 
If a band is playing, the songs should be mostly salsa and should not be more 
than 5 - 7 minutes in length.&nbsp; The volume of the music, whether by DJ or band, 
should not be too loud.&nbsp; The <u>quality</u> of the song makes us dance, not the 
<u>loudness</u>; and we 
like to talk and socialize also, so we need to be able to hear each other.&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">8</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.&nbsp; <u>The Dance Floor&nbsp;</u> -</b>&nbsp; Dancing salsa &quot;On 2&quot; is 
very complicated, beautiful and active, and it involves quite a bit of spinning, 
especially by the ladies.&nbsp; Therefore we need a good dance floor.&nbsp; This 
is very important.&nbsp; The best dance floors are made of smooth wood and are 
finished to a &quot;medium speed&quot; so that one can spin and move smoothly.&nbsp; If a 
dance floor is too &quot;slow&quot;, rough, uneven or hard (such as rough stone tiles or 
cement), it puts great stress on our ankles and knees when we spin, even causes 
injuries, and it destroys our expensive dance shoes.&nbsp; If a floor is too 
smooth and slippery, then it is dangerous because we might fall and injure 
ourselves.&nbsp; Any indoor events such as in clubs or studios should have a 
good floor.&nbsp; We make an exception for outdoor events such as summer 
festivals and parks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And the dance floor must be regularly maintained.&nbsp; If 
food, drinks or other substances are spilled on the floor, it must be properly 
cleaned and conditioned before it is used by the &quot;On 2&quot; mambo dancers.&nbsp; And 
periodically, the floor must be sanded and refinished.&nbsp; Most general clubs 
or events do not have to concern themselves much with the surface of the dance 
floor because their customers are not skilled dancers doing fast, intricate 
spinning moves.&nbsp; But mambo &quot;On 2&quot; involves skill, precision and balance, 
so the dance floor must be good quality and well maintained.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The dance floor area should be lit well enough so that we 
can see our partners clearly, especially their hands so that we can lead and follow.&nbsp; 
Very dark rooms, or strobe lights, moving spotlights, spinning disco light 
balls, or lights flashing in sync with the music are no good for us.&nbsp; 
Imagine doing a triple spin and then searching for your partner's hands when the lights 
are flashing or it's very dark.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">9</font></b><font face="Arial"><b>.&nbsp; <u>We List Events At Our Discretion</u>&nbsp;

<p><font face="Arial"><b><br>
10.&nbsp; <u>Additional Attractions For These Dancers</u>&nbsp; -</b>&nbsp; 
There are a few things you can do as a promoter to attract more &quot;On 2&quot; dancers to your 
dancing event.&nbsp; The strongest attraction would be that you have a show by a mambo dance performing group.&nbsp; Good 
dancers as well as the general public love to watch a dance show.&nbsp; See our
<a href="performers1.htm">Directory Of Performing Groups</a> for a listing of 
excellent teams who show their artistry locally and around the world.&nbsp; 
These listings provide pictures of the dancers and 
complete contact information.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can offer an &quot;On 2&quot; dance lesson so that new customers can 
learn to dance mambo and feel more comfortable coming to your present and future 
events.&nbsp; The dance lesson should be held either before the main event, or 
in a separate room during the event.&nbsp; Never stop a dancing event to hold a 
lesson.&nbsp; See our <a href="../magazine/instructors/home.htm">Directory of 
Mambo Instructors</a> for a complete listing of independent professional 
teachers and how to contact them.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">While many mambo dancers like the same beverages as other 
people, some of them like non-alcoholic drinks.&nbsp; For clubs, you can still make a 
profit at your bar.&nbsp; You should put out on display such beverages as sodas, sports drinks, fruit juices, ice teas, 
bottled water, Red Bull, etc., as well as a sign offering &quot;virgin drinks&quot; (standard cocktails 
without the alcohol).&nbsp; You should also consider having waiters circulating 
around to reach out 
to those dancers sitting or standing near the dance floor, since they often 
become so engrossed in dancing and watching that they forget to drink.&nbsp; And 
you may wish to consider adding a $1 service charge for drinks brought by 
waiters to make sure they are tipped properly.<br>

How To Get Your Event or Club Listed On
<a href="http://www.SalsaNewYork.com">www.SalsaNewYork.com</a>&nbsp; -</b>&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>1)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Your event must meet the 
requirements listed above&nbsp; -</b>&nbsp; Especially important is the type and 
amount of music.&nbsp; The music should be mostly&nbsp; &quot;classic salsa&quot; as 
described above.&nbsp; The mix of music must be <i><b>at least 75% classic salsa 
played every hour.</b></i>&nbsp; That means <i><b>45 minutes of classic salsa played 
during each &amp; every hour of the entire event</b></i>, taking into account all 
other music, the announcements, the band if you have one, a dance lesson, any 
ceremonies, comedy act, promotions or awards, etc.&nbsp; The only exception to 
this is a dance performance, which counts as dance time.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If an event states that it runs from 10:00 PM - 2:00 AM, 
then classic salsa must be playing for 45 minutes during <i><b>each</b></i> of 
those 4 hours.&nbsp; This does not mean 90 minutes of salsa and then 30 minutes 
of some other type of music.&nbsp; No break of salsa music should be longer than 
15 minutes, whether it is in the form of some other music, announcements, 
awards, ceremonies, comedy, or anything else.&nbsp; The point here is that <i>
<b>the 
event should be providing classic salsa dance music for 75% of every hour, 45 
minutes, with no break in the salsa music for longer than 15 minutes.</b></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We post on our Calendar only those events which follow the 
music guidelines above, and who stick to those guidelines.&nbsp; If a promoter 
or DJ says:&nbsp; &quot;we play what the crowd wants, and if they want a lot of 
merengue or English music, then that's what we will play&quot;, then that event does 
not get posted on our Calendar.&nbsp; Our viewers go to events posted on our 
Calendar expecting to find 75% classic salsa and that is what they should find.&nbsp; 
That is the service we are offering.&nbsp; We only list those events which which 
make a commitment to play the 75% classic salsa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><u>Please Note</u>&nbsp; -&nbsp; Over the years, we have had 
various promoters lie about the amount of salsa being played at their events.&nbsp; 
In order to get their event listed on the <a href="../calendar.htm">SalsaNewYork 
Calendar</a>, they say there will be at least 75% classic salsa when this is not 
true.&nbsp; When we catch them, they are banned from being listed on the
<a href="../calendar.htm">Calendar</a> and their future relationship with us is 
impaired.&nbsp; We also spread the word that they are dishonest promoters.&nbsp; 
<u>Warning:</u>&nbsp; Do not ask us to list an event if it does not meet our music 
requirements.&nbsp; We will find out.&nbsp; In addition to ourselves, we have a 
large and very active group of dedicated On 2 mambo dancers, most of whom are 
our personal friends, who attend events all over the New York/New Jersey
