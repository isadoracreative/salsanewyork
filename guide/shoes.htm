<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u><strong>WHERE TO BUY AND REPAIR <a
name="SHOES">SHOES</a> FOR DANCING</strong></u></font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here are a few stores to start your search for
salsa dancing shoes, which are basically ballroom and/or jazz shoes.&nbsp; Call first to
check for addresses and stock (these stores tend to move from time to time, or to
discontinue certain shoe lines).&nbsp; Remember that many salsa dancers dance in 
regular street shoes, especially the men.&nbsp; This is a topic of disagreement, 
with some dancers saying one must absolutely wear professional dance shoes and 
with other dancers saying that, as long as your shoes are comfortable &amp; 
supportive and have the proper sole, you can dance very well in street shoes.&nbsp; 
It's really just a matter of personal preference.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Regarding the sole:&nbsp; Depending on the 
dance surface, you will need different soles on your shoes, ranging from 
slippery to sticky.&nbsp; Hard smooth leather is the most slippery, suede is 
somewhat &quot;medium&quot;, and rubber with a design in it is the most sticky.&nbsp; Most 
serious dancers have several pairs of shoes with different soles so they can be 
prepared for any surface, and many also bring along baby powder for very sticky 
floors and stick on pads or a wire brush for very slippery floors.&nbsp; Shoe 
repair shops can easily change the sole of any shoe.&nbsp; An old trick for a 
too slippery dance floor is to pour a little bit of Coca Cola or other soda on 
the edge of the floor and then soak the soles of your shoes in the Coke.&nbsp; 
It makes the shoes a bit stickier for a little while.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><br>
<font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><u>Where To Repair Shoes -&nbsp;</u>&nbsp; </strong>
Here again there is a difference of opinion as to whether you should have 
dancing shoes repaired at a specialist or at just any neighborhood shoe repair.&nbsp; 
If you want a dance shoe specialist, there are probably a number of shoe repair 
places specializing in dance shoes, but this is the only one I know of.&nbsp; 
He's been there for years, is trusted by dancers, and has
somewhat above-average Manhattan prices. <u>&nbsp;</u><font color="#FF0000"><b><u>Please 
note:</u>&nbsp; This list was put together in the early 2000's, so be sure to 
call places to make sure they're still there.</b></font></font></p>

<strong><font face="Arial"><u>STREET SHOES OR DANCING SHOES&nbsp; -&nbsp;</u> <a
name="Which_Shoes">Which Shoes</a> For Different Dance Surfaces?</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><br>
<font face="Arial">You go to the Copa, it's so slippery you almost fall.&nbsp; You go to
other places, the floor is very sticky, uneven or rough, or an outdoor event has dancing
on pavement, grass or Astro-Turf.&nbsp; What shoes are best to wear?&nbsp; The answer is
&quot;different shoes&quot;.&nbsp; Experienced dancers have shoes with different bottoms
for these different dancing surfaces.&nbsp; If the floor is sticky, you need smooth
leather or maybe suede bottoms.&nbsp; If the floor is slippery, you'll probably need some
kind of rubber bottoms on your shoes.&nbsp; If it's pavement, like at an outdoor event in
the summer, you don't want to use  suede bottom dance shoes (eg.
Capezio) because the pavement will ruin the suede bottoms.&nbsp; For that matter, so will
walking in the street, especially in wet weather.&nbsp; That's why you'll see some dancers
wearing their street shoes to get to a club, and then changing to dancing shoes once they
get there.&nbsp; The one shoe that seems to be good for all surfaces, and can be worn in
the street, is the Capezio dance sneaker, which comes in different colors.&nbsp; Great for
classes, practicing, outdoor events, and studio parties, it is unfortunately not really
dressy enough for more dressed-up events and clubs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Some people like to wear genuine dancing shoes out.
&nbsp; Others use certain street shoes which they've found are good for dancing.&nbsp; You
have to experiment and find what suits you and your dancing style best.&nbsp; Most dancing
and dress shoes come with leather soles which may be too slippery for certain dance
surfaces.&nbsp; You can get a <u>very thin rubber layer</u> put onto the soles of your
shoes which prevents them from slipping on a slick dance floor (such as the Copacabana 
or some studios).
&nbsp; The rubber has a grid pattern for adhesion, and is either glued or sewn onto your
present leather soles by a shoe repair shop.&nbsp; Because it is thin, your shoe's sole
stays almost the same thickness, so that it is almost as flexible, and it doesn't get a
&quot;bulky&quot; look to it.&nbsp; One brand is called &quot;Sole Guard&quot;, but there
are others as well.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">These can be put onto <u>dancing shoes</u> that are
slipping.&nbsp; They can also be put onto <u>street shoes</u>, for those of you who don't
like to wear dancing shoes out to a club.&nbsp; Although nothing beats dancing shoes for
comfort, flexibility,&nbsp; lightness and quickness, street shoes are often almost as
good, and are tougher for wearing on the street, especially in bad weather, to and from
the club or salsa event, and often blend better with the rest of your&nbsp; outfit.&nbsp; <font
size="3">Remember one thing though: &nbsp; since these rubber bottoms are designed to
prevent you from slipping, they also prevent you from spinning as well.&nbsp; For the
ladies, if you want to do double and triple turns on a dance floor that's a little rough
or sticky, these rubber bottoms would not be good.&nbsp; An alternative is to 
tell the guy not to spin you multiple times and for you to do walkaround turns.&nbsp; For the guys, if all you do are
single or 1 1/2 turns, you'll be OK with these;&nbsp; but if you do multiple spins or axle
turns, these rubber bottoms will make it very difficult.&nbsp; As I mention above,
professional and serious dancers often have several shoes each with different soles, and
choose which shoe to wear based on the floor surface where they'll be dancing.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">These thin rubber layers can be gotten at most
shoe repair shops, at prices ranging from $14 to around $20.&nbsp; The important
consideration is that they be as thin as possible.&nbsp; I get mine at <b>Men's Fashionable
Shoe Repair</b>, 196 Seventh Avenue (between 21st &amp; 22nd Streets), NYC. &nbsp;
212-675-0718, at a cost of $14.&nbsp; They can also be gotten at Pete's Theatrical Shoe
Repair at Capezio (see above);&nbsp; these come thicker, but replace the original
half-sole, and cost more.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">And here are three emergency measures for
slippery dancing conditions.&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Many shoe repair shops sell a little <u>stick-on
pad</u> that you apply to the bottoms of your shoes.&nbsp; One brand is called
&quot;Shur-Grip&quot;.&nbsp; The pads have a gritty surface, so they prevent
slipping.&nbsp; They only last a little while, probably a few nights of dancing.&nbsp; You
could buy a few of these and keep them with you for certain occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've
only seen them in women's sizes, although these small pads could be used on men's shoes
and would still be helpful.&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; <u>A small stiff wire shoe brush</u>&nbsp;can be
bought in most shoe stores, such as <a href="#World_Tone">World Tone</a> .&nbsp; If you
find yourself slipping, you can scrape the soles of your shoes with the wire brush, and
they'll stick a little better. &nbsp; 3)&nbsp; T<u>he sticky soda solution:&nbsp;</u> Get
some soda like Coke, 7 Up, ginger ale, etc., and pour some on a napkin or the floor.&nbsp;
Then dab your shoe soles in the soda;&nbsp; if they are leather or suede, let the leather
really soak up the soda.&nbsp; Because the soda has sugar and/or syrup, it makes the shoes
more sticky temporarily, at least for a few dances.&nbsp; Keep the soda around so you can
keep applying more as the shoes get slippery again.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>Special Stick-On Sole For Different Dance 
Surfaces</u> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.soles2dance.com/">
Soles2Dance</a> is a high-tech, dual-material stick-on sole that is exactly 
designed to resolve the problems of bad dance floors; it even works well on 
concrete and asphalt.&nbsp; The stick-on sole patch has 1 section that is sticky 
which helps you to dance on slippery floors, and another section that is 
slippery which helps you for sticky floors.&nbsp; These 2 sections are built 
into one overall patch which you stick onto your shoes, enabling you to dance on 
any surface.&nbsp; This special sole is designed &amp; distributed by a dancer who 
is also a fitness instructor &amp; engineer.&nbsp; You can see pictures, pricing &amp;
