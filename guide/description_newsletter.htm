    <td width="48%"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><u><a name="WELCOME">WELCOME</a> TO
    THE WORLD OF NEW YORK STYLE ON 2 MAMBO<a name="EVENTOS"> </a></u></strong>-&nbsp; Hello
    and welcome all salsa dancers to <a href="http://www.SalsaNewYork.com">www.SalsaNewYork.com</a>
    . &nbsp;Manny Siverio and I co-host this web site as a public service in our&nbsp;spare
    time, out of our love and passion for&nbsp;dancing mambo On 2.&nbsp; We have filled it
    with a tremendous amount of dancing information to enrich your mambo experience and to
    help you quickly find many dancing resources which are available, so you can spend more
    time dancing and less time doing all the searching that we and others before us had to do.
    &nbsp;We offer this info to ALL salsa dancers everywhere, regardless of what particular
    timing and style they may use.&nbsp; This is your&nbsp;resource, and we want you to get
    all you can out of it.&nbsp; We invite you to check out the entire web site on a regular
    basis, and especially whenever you're making plans to go out dancing, or when you just
    need your salsa fix.&nbsp; We update it frequently,&nbsp; sometimes daily, whenever new
    information&nbsp; comes in.&nbsp; Click on <a href="navigate.htm">Navigate</a> to see how
    to find all our information quickly and easily. </font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">This
    is a specialty, niche web site, like a &quot;mambo enthusiast's fan club&quot;, written
    for and about certain On 2&nbsp; mambo dancers who dance what is often called 
    &quot;New York&quot;,
    &quot;club&quot;, &quot;street&quot;, &quot;Latino&quot; or &quot;Eddie Torres&quot; style salsa, a style most often
    associated with the <a href="../magazine/instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a>
    method, as well as the more than 60 other independent <a
    href="../ourdancemusic.htm#DEFINITION">NY/NJ instructors &amp; studios</a> who teach &amp;
    dance this same way exclusively out of their preference and passion for this particular
    method.&nbsp; As is normal for most &quot;fan clubs&quot;, we consider part of our mission
    to expand the world of this particular form of On 2 mambo by bringing together those who
    wish to dance in this way, by providing information to increase their knowledge as 
    On 2
    dancers, by helping to define and enlarge this particular On 2 community, and by furnishing a directory of independent instructors who teach this method
    <u>exclusively</u> out of their personal preference, commitment and passion for this way of
    dancing mambo.&nbsp; We choose instructors who we believe share our singular commitment to
    dancing only in this way, who's primary interest, preference and natural feeling follows this
    method, who share our desire to expand the numbers of people dancing in this favorite way,
    and who desire to pass on this conviction to their students .</font></p>
    <font face="Arial">
    <div>
      Also, our belief is that the only way to really understand and excel in 
      dancing On 2 is to dance this way <u>only</u>.&nbsp; Because of that, we&nbsp;don't 
      believe in teaching multiple timings.&nbsp; The many reasons given for teaching 
      multiple timings by various studios has never made sense to us.&nbsp; It just 
      confuses and limits those who might become truly accomplished in On 2.&nbsp; 
      And it stands in the way of their feeling the rhythms of the music in the 
      On 2 way.&nbsp; This is why studios like Eddie Torres, Santo Rico, Karisma, 
      Jimmy Anton, Yamulee, Carlos Konig, Mario B, Ismael Otero and many others 
      teach only On 2, not a mix of timings.&nbsp; If these people can teach and 
      perform exclusively On 2, then so can anyone else who says that they 
      prefer to dance On 2.</div>
    </font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To clarify how we dance mambo:&nbsp; We step on the 1st,
    2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th beats in the 8 beat salsa measure, and not on 4th and 8th,
    with the man beginning back with his left foot and the woman beginning forward with her
    right foot on the 1st beat of the measure.&nbsp; We dance forward and back in a line or &quot;slot&quot;,
    not side-to-side or in a circle or square.&nbsp; We &quot;Break On 2&quot;, meaning that
    we change direction on the 2nd beat, and also on the 6th beat.&nbsp; See the detailed
    description by clicking on <a href="../ourdancemusic.htm#DEFINITION">On 2 Defined</a>.
    &nbsp; When the term &quot;On 2&quot; is used on this web site, it refers to this specific
    method.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This method is technically different from other ways of
    dancing to salsa music, including some which also &quot;break On 2&quot;,&nbsp; such as <a
    href="http://www.nfo.net/.LNX/ldance1.html#NE">ballroom</a> , <a
    href="http://fredastaire.com/">international</a> , <a href="http://www.razzmtazz.com/">Razz
    M' Tazz</a> , Cuban son montuno, as well as any others which step on 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 ,
    those which &quot;break&quot; on 1, 3, or 4, and those which do not dance in a line or
    &quot;slot&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></td>

    <td width="48%" valign="top"><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">This dancer's web
    site is especially for this particular type of On 2 dancer, as well everyone else who
    would like to find out more about this exciting and unique way of dancing which is
    spreading around the world.&nbsp; Please note that this web site does not claim to cover
    all aspects of the salsa scene, but rather just those of special interest to this
    particular group of On 2 mambo dancers who want to share partner dancing, turn patterns
    and shines with others who use the same method, so that the 2 partners can move together
    in a coordinated and synchronized way.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">This is a non-commercial, <u>personal</u>,
    public service&nbsp; web site, set up to share information among the several thousand On 2
    salsa-mambo dancers in the New York City metropolitan area, as well as other interested
    dancers from around the world.&nbsp; We specialize.&nbsp; We are not
    exclusionary....there's a big difference.&nbsp; It's human nature for people to join
    together to share a common interest.&nbsp; We attempt to be an information source, a
    &quot;partner search service&quot;,&nbsp;helping these particular dancers find places to
    go where lots of salsa is played and others are dancing On 2 in the same way, and to
    provide articles and resources of particular interest to them. &nbsp; <font
    color="#FF0000"><u>Please note, however, that nothing here is meant to suggest that
    different ways of dancing to salsa music are any less legitimate or less enjoyable.&nbsp;
    No offense is meant, and none should be taken.</u></font>&nbsp; &nbsp;The world is a big
    place with plenty of room for all the many ways of dancing mambo.&nbsp; There are other
    specialty web sites which focus on these other timings and styles of dancing to salsa, and
    we invite you to check them out.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">From the very beginning, there have always
been a few negative people who have misunderstood and criticized the idea of a web site
which focuses on just one way of dancing to salsa music.&nbsp; They have stated that it was in
some way exclusionary, arrogant, or suggesting that other ways of dancing to salsa were
less legitimate or less enjoyable.&nbsp; This is totally not true.&nbsp; And we have never
understood their criticism.&nbsp; Why is it OK to have a &quot;NY Yankee fan club&quot;
which does not include Mets fans, or a &quot;Ford Mustang fan club&quot; which does not
include Chevy owners, or a &quot;<a
href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/thehotjenniferlopez">Jennifer Lopez fan club</a>&quot;
that doesn't deal with Puffy (anymore), or a <a
href="http://home-3.worldonline.nl/~pjetax/">merengue web site</a> which doesn't cover
salsa, or a <a href="http://www.salsasf.com/">salsa web site</a> which doesn't include
bachata and bomba-plena, but it's not OK to have an On 2 web site which does not cover
other ways of dancing salsa?&nbsp; This On 2 web site offers people with a similar
interest and passion the opportunity to share it with others, and to expand and deepen
their involvement in this dance, and to widen their circle of friends....even
internationally.&nbsp; That sounds pretty good to us!&nbsp; We are very gratified to see the
numbers of people who enjoy dancing On 2 growing every year, and we consider expanding that
growth to be one of the goals of this web site.&nbsp; We openly and happily promote dancing 
On 2.</font></p>
