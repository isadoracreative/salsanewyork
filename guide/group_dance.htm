  &quot;FELLAS, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE LADY LOOK GOOD&quot; -</strong>&nbsp;</u></font><font face="Arial"> 
  That's what
  <a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com/magazine/instructors/eddie_torres.htm">
  Eddie Torres </a>always used to&nbsp;tell us&nbsp;in class when we loaded the ladies up 
  with too many turn patterns, dancing off timing,&nbsp;or jerky rough leads.&nbsp; And to 
  say this another way, paraphrasing the words of instructor &amp; performer
  <a href="http://www.cobobrothers.com/miltonbio.htm">Milton Cobo</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;the man 
  should aim to&nbsp;satisfy his partner on the dance floor. &nbsp;Whether she&nbsp;is a 
  beginner, intermediate, or advanced dancer, he&nbsp;should make sure that when the 
  song&nbsp;is over she&nbsp;is fulfilled.<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Arial"><strong>The Group Dance -</strong>&nbsp; 
  Obviously, this applies when one couple is dancing.&nbsp; The man should make the 
  lead smooth and flowing, and in time with the music.&nbsp; But the worst situation 
  we often see is when several men are taking turns dancing with one woman.&nbsp; 
  This happens spontaneously at mambo events and is traditional for birthday 
  dances.&nbsp; What&nbsp;often happens is that the woman is being used&nbsp;like a rag doll or 
  punching bag while the guys compete with each other to show off their latest &amp; 
  most difficult moves.&nbsp; Often, the guys start cutting in on each other 
  aggressively&nbsp;in the middle of a measure/bar, grabbing the woman roughly and off 
  timing, with no attempt to smooth her transition from one partner to another.&nbsp; 
  This is just bad dancing.&nbsp; It is male self indulgence &amp; competition at its 
  worst, and it is completely disrespectful to the woman.</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">This last Sunday at
  <a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com/details.htm#ANTON">Jimmy Anton's Latin 
  Sundays Social</a>, I was fortunate to be a part of one of these &quot;group 
  dances&quot; that was done the right way.&nbsp; The woman was
  <a href="../picture_page1.htm#Group_Dance">Ivana Bochinska</a>, a wonderful 
  dancer who is smooth, graceful and very feminine.&nbsp; She is a former performer 
  with <a href="http://www.jaicandy.com">Jai &amp; Candy's</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a href="http://www.jaicandy.com/photo-gallery/photogallery_05.html">Estilo 
  Clasico Dance Company</a> (currently with the
  <a href="Performers/SantoRico.htm">Santo Rico Dance Company</a>).&nbsp; In addition to me, the men were
  <a href="http://www.cobobrothers.com/miltonbio.htm">Milton Cobo</a>,
  <a href="../picture_page1.htm#Group_Dance">Eric Baez</a>,
  <a href="../picture_page1.htm#Group_Dance">Patrick Morris</a>, and 
  <a href="../picture_page1.htm#Group_Dance">Tamambo</a>, an instructor from 
  England and director of the Salsa With Atti-Tude Dance Company.&nbsp; What made this group 
  dance &quot;right&quot; is that <a href="../picture_page1.htm#Group_Dance">Ivana</a> was 
  always the star of the dance, and the changes from one partner to another were 
  made within the timing of the music and the turn pattern being done by the 
  previous male partner.&nbsp; Sure there was a bit of competition going on as well 
  as the occasional screw-up of the lead, but we all were trying to make
  <a href="../picture_page1.htm#Group_Dance">Ivana's</a> dance a good one.&nbsp; And 
  that made it fun for everyone....including the many spectators!&nbsp; </font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">The experience made me think of the many group dances I've 
  watched over the years, and how some are so nice and other are so bad.&nbsp; So 
  here are some guidelines for you fellas when more than one guy dances with the 
  same woman.<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Pay Attention To The Lady -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
  just 2 people dance, we pay attention to our partner and help her enjoy the 
  song.&nbsp; When 5 or 10 guys dance with the same partner, we STILL should pay primary 
  attention to our partner and help her enjoy the song.&nbsp; What makes the group 
  dance harder is that we are also paying attention to the other guys, but our 
  FIRST responsibility as good dancers is&nbsp;STILL to fulfill our partner, and 
  that's the woman.&nbsp; Let's face it, these group dances usually involve some 
  competition between some&nbsp;the guys:&nbsp; who has the fanciest turn patterns, who 
  can impress the woman or the crowd the most, who gets the first &amp; last turn 
  with her, etc.&nbsp; But remember,&nbsp;the competition is not the most important part 
  of the dance.&nbsp; You are not dancing with those other guys.&nbsp; <em><strong>Most 
  importantly, you are dancing with a woman, she is your partner, so pay 
  attention to her first &amp; foremost.<br>
&nbsp;</strong></em></font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Arial"><strong>When &amp; How To Cut In 
  -</strong>&nbsp; Don't fight with the other guys for dance time with the woman.&nbsp; 
  Don't cut in aggressively or out of synch with what the other guy is doing, or 
  out of timing with the music.&nbsp; <em><strong>There is a proper time to cut in.&nbsp; 
  It's not just any time you want.</strong></em>&nbsp; It's almost always on the 1st 
  beat of the measure, and occasionally on the 5th beat.&nbsp; It's when the other 
  guy does something with his turn pattern that gives you an opening to SMOOTHLY 
  pick up the woman.&nbsp; The easiest moment is just after a cross body lead, but 
  other points may work equally smoothly.&nbsp; Often the guy dancing with the woman 
  signals the next guy to cut in by looking at him or tapping him with his 
  hand.&nbsp; Most importantly, <em><strong>the transition from one guy to another 
  should be SMOOTH for the lady.</strong></em>&nbsp; In fact, it should almost be as 
  if it were the same lead, as if by&nbsp;the same&nbsp;man.&nbsp; For example, the man dancing 
  gives her a cross body lead and is holding her right hand with his left hand.&nbsp; 
  The new partner smoothly steps in beside her, placing his right hand behind 
  her back on 6, 7, smoothly takes her right hand replacing the other guy's left 
  hand, and smoothly leads her into a cross body lead on 1.&nbsp; She should hardly 
  notice the change from one&nbsp;partner to another.<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Arial"><strong>Take Turns Fairly -</strong>&nbsp; 
  &quot;Don't fight with the other guys for dance time with the woman&quot; means <em>
  <strong>wait your turn</strong></em>.&nbsp; If there are 8 guys, let the other 7 
  have their turns before you cut in again.&nbsp; Also, let the guy dancing with the 
  woman have some time with her, not just 1 or 2 bars.&nbsp; He should not have to be 
  &quot;dancing defensively&quot; to keep you away just so he can have enough time to 
  connect, do a few turns and cross body leads and, most importantly, pay some 
  attention to her.&nbsp; <em><strong>Give them some time &amp; space.</strong></em>&nbsp; And 
  on the other side, <strong><em>don't hog her</em></strong> once you get her.&nbsp; 
  The group dance is about sharing equally and respecting each other's time with 
  the lady.&nbsp; Keep it fair.&nbsp; Keep it graceful.&nbsp; Keep it smooth.&nbsp; Keep her 
  enjoying the dance.</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">And when the dance is over, make sure she walks away 
  fulfilled!<br>
&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Arial"><strong>Ladies, Don't Take It 
  Anymore -</strong>&nbsp; I've seen some ladies let the guys know quite clearly when 
  they don't like how they're being treated on the dance floor.&nbsp; But many of you 
  just stay quiet and suffer with bad timing, rough or aggressive leads, crazy 
  turn patterns, too many turn patterns, and partners who are more into 
  themselves than into you.&nbsp; For those of you who just stay quiet, let me say 
  this:&nbsp; Don't take it anymore.&nbsp; Whether it's dancing with one partner or 
  several partners, you have every right to tell a partner if you don't like 
  what he's doing.&nbsp; Believe me, it happens to all of us guys from time to time, 
  and we will not be destroyed....nor will we get destructive.&nbsp; It may be 
  uncomfortable for a few moments for us, but hopefully we will eventually learn 
  to improve our dancing if a woman tells us we're doing something unpleasant.&nbsp; 
  So ladies, you have the right to tell a guy to stop doing something that you 
  don't like, or to tell him&nbsp;to lead more smoothly or gently, or to cut you 
  loose, etc.&nbsp; And if he doesn't, then just walk off the dance floor!&nbsp; Believe 
  me, you will get plenty of support from everyone around you.....including us 
  guys.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Steve Shaw<br>
