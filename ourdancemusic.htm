<a href="magazine/instructors/luis_zegarra.htm">Luiz Zegarra</a>, and many others. &nbsp; It is clearly spelled out in the highly recommended <a href="">Eddie Torres Salsa Teaching Videos</a> listed below.&nbsp; This way of dancing salsa is often referred to as "New York', "club", "street", "Latino" or "Eddie Torres" style. &nbsp; This method is different from "<a href="http://www.nfo.net/.LNX/ldance1.html#NE">ballroom</a>" , "<a href="http://fredastaire.com/">international</a>" and Cuban son montuno styles, and also different than some of what is taught at other New York area studios such as&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dancesport.com/">DanceSport</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.steppingoutstudios.com/">Stepping Out</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.razzmtazz.com/">Razz M' Tazz</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.culturalexplosion.com/menu.htm">Cultural Explosion</a> and others. &nbsp; It is different from those whose which step on 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and those which break on 1, 3 or 4, and those who do not dance in a line or "slot".&nbsp; It is different from others which also may "break on 2", such as&nbsp; <a href="http://www.razzmtazz.com/">Razz M' Tazz</a>, Cuban son montuno, and those who step on 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>The Salsa Music -</u>&nbsp; Salsa music is played in 4/4 time, and has 4 beats to the measure or bar, and we dance within 2 measures, so we count 8 beats; and loosely say that we "dance to an 8 beat measure or bar", although technically it is two 4 beat measures.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many dances, not just salsa, are done within 2 measures, and therefore some people use the terms "musician's measure" and "dancer's measure".&nbsp; The "musician's measure" has 4 beats, while the "dancer's measure" has 8 beats and consists of 2 "musician's measures".&nbsp; For more on our music and how it should be played for mambo dancers, see our section <a href="guide/song_list.htm">Guidelines for DJs &amp; Recommended Songs</a> .</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><u>The ON 2 <a href="" name="Basic_Step">Basic Step</a> -</u></strong>&nbsp; In our basic step, the man's left foot goes back and the woman's right foot goes forward on the 1st beat of this so-called 8 beat measure or bar.&nbsp; We step with our feet on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, 6th, and 7th beats of the measure .&nbsp; We do not step on the 4th and 8th beats.&nbsp; We actually "break" our movement, in other words we change body direction, on the 2nd and 6th beats of the measure.&nbsp; We call it "breaking on 2",&nbsp; or "dancing on 2", or "bailando en dos".&nbsp; This is mambo, danced forward and back, in a line or slot, not side to side or in a circle or square.&nbsp; You can see this step precisely demonstrated and broken down into its separate elements in the <a href="">Eddie Torres Teaches Salsa</a> videos.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">For how to understand the timing in the music, and how to find the 1st beat of the measure, click on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWFhlhgy1c&amp;list=RDvwWFhlhgy1c#t=211">Eddie Torres' "It's All In The Timing" </a>.&nbsp; At that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWFhlhgy1c&amp;list=RDvwWFhlhgy1c#t=211"> same link</a> are other videos for finding the timing in the music.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>Our basic step is as follows:</u><br />
		<br />
		<u>1st beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; The man steps back with his left foot. &nbsp;&nbsp; The woman steps forward with her right foot.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>2nd beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; The man steps farther back with his right foot, then changes direction, starting to lean forward with his body = "breaks forward on 2".&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman steps farther forward with her left foot, then changes direction, starting to lean back with her body = "breaking back on 2".</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>3rd beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; The man steps in place with his left foot, while his body is moving forward.&nbsp; The woman steps in place with her right foot, while her body is moving backward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>4th beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; No steps.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>5th beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; The man &nbsp; steps forward with his right foot, in front of his left foot.&nbsp; The woman steps backward with her left foot, behind her right foot. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>6th beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; The man steps farther forward with his left foot, then changes direction, starting to lean backward with his body = "breaks back on 6".&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman steps farther back with her right foot, then changes direction, starting to lean forward = "breaks forward on 6".&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u>7th beat of the measure -</u>&nbsp; The man steps in place with his right foot, while his body is moving backward.&nbsp; The woman steps in place with her left foot, while her body is moving forward.&nbsp; </font></p>

		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Technically, it is proper to start the dance in the following way:&nbsp; You walk onto the dance floor with your partner, set up the standard partner position frame, and then begin on the 6th beat of the measure, with the man stepping forward with his left foot and the woman stepping back with her right.&nbsp; On the 7th beat, the couple changes direction, with the man rocking back onto his right foot and the woman rocking forward onto her left foot.&nbsp; They then go right into the basic step pattern which is maintained through the rest of the song:&nbsp; the man's left foot goes back and the woman's right foot goes forward on the 1st beat of the measure, and the pattern continues as described above in detail.&nbsp; Although this is technically the proper way to start, most New York dancers simply begin on the 1st beat of the measure as described above, sometimes not even setting up the partner position first.</font></p>

		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><u>How To Go <a href="" name="About_Learning">About Learning</a> Our Dance -&nbsp;Some Words Of Advice To Students &amp; "Jacks Of All Dances" -</u>&nbsp; </strong>There is a lot of discussion about how New Yorkers dance On 2, and how that relates to the clave, the cowbells, the congas, etc., and how one must be attending to those instruments in order to learn how to dance On 2</font><font face="Arial">.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; These discussions are usually by those who are not primarily and dominantly On 2 dancers. &nbsp; Here in the New York metropolitan area, when we learn to dance On 2 from friends or in classes, whether it is with <a href="magazine/instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a>, the "Mambo King", or any of the many other excellent instructors <a href="http://www.salsanewyork.com/moreinfo.htm#DEFINITION">noted above</a> , we are not paying much, if any, attention to the clave or these other instruments.&nbsp; That is a much later focus in our learning.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In fact, when we initially learn any part of this dance, whether it is the basic step or shines, or more advanced turn patterns, we do not even play the music at all.&nbsp; Instead, we count out loud "1, 2, 3,&nbsp; 5, 6, 7" while learning to place our feet or hands in the proper positions.&nbsp; In order to really understand the feeling of the clave and conga rhythms when dancing On 2, one usually must FIRST be an intermediate or advanced On 2 dancer.&nbsp; And that means that one must have mastered the footwork, timing, partnerwork and open shines to the extent that they are <u>automatic</u>, and that they feel like the only natural way to move to this music.&nbsp; I am not saying that this is the only way to learn our step, but rather that it is the most common method of instruction currently.&nbsp; As with music, while some may learn to play by ear, the majority learn by using a the standardized systematic notation;&nbsp; some may learn mambo in other ways, but the majority here learn by breaking down the dance into the count and the various turn and open shine patterns, many of which have names.&nbsp; By the way, if you do not have access to New York area mambo classes, or would like to supplement your class learning, I highly recommend the <a href="">Eddie Torres Training Videos</a> in order to learn the correct fundamental and intermediate skills.&nbsp; You will find the other <a href="">On 2 Training Videos</a> listed below to be very helpful too.&nbsp; Also, there are now a lot of videos on <a href="http://www.YouTube.com">www.YouTube.com</a> that show New York style On 2 mambo dancing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Counting out the 1, 2, 3, and 5, 6, 7 is only used for learning and communicating to others when we "break down" the dance into it's components.&nbsp; We use it when we learn as beginners, and then later as intermediate or advanced dancers when we learn new turn patterns or open shines.&nbsp; And we use the counting to explain to others as we "break down" our moves.&nbsp; The count is the schematic diagram of the dance, in the same way musical notation is the schematic diagram of a piece of music.&nbsp; But when we are just dancing for fun, or when performing, we do not count.&nbsp; We just dance to the music.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u>Skip the academic discussions, just learn to dance On 2 -</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's how we learn:&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, find the beginning of the measure, the 1st beat.&nbsp; Almost all music has measures (salsa, cha cha, disco, R &amp; B, soul, rock, hip hop, reggae, classical, jazz, etc.), and one must learn to find the 1st beat of the measure.&nbsp; For how to understand the timing in the music, and how to find the 1st beat of the measure, click on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWFhlhgy1c&amp;list=RDvwWFhlhgy1c#t=211">Eddie Torres' "It's All In The Timing" </a>.&nbsp; For some more help with this, see <a href="magazine/articles/finding_clave.htm">Manny Siverio's Article</a> article on how to find the beginning of the salsa measure, his review of <a href="magazine/articles/review_aotc_counting_cd.htm">Mike Bello's Practice &amp; Counting CD</a> , and the <a href="">Jai &amp; Candy Timing CD</a>,&nbsp; which include learning to count the beats in the salsa music.&nbsp; It is difficult to explain in writing how to find the 1st beat, since songs start their measures differently, sometimes even changing from verse to verse.&nbsp; Sometimes it's signaled by the singer, but other times it's the chorus, the clave, the congas or the bass, and it may keep changing.&nbsp; My other advice is to find someone who knows how to find the 1 in the music, whether it's a teacher, friend, relative, fellow dancer or musician;&nbsp; some people just know the 1 and can show it to you.&nbsp; Put on some salsa music and have them show you the 1, and explain how they found it.&nbsp; Then have them help you learn to feel it, count it and tap your feet all the way through entire songs.&nbsp; A good exercise is to stop and then restart the song to see how quickly you can find the 1 and get on the beat again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Second of all, when you have learned to find, feel and tap your foot to the 1st and the 7 other beats in the salsa measure, then begin your count and step as spelled out above:&nbsp; 1,2,3 and 5,6,7.&nbsp; Ladies always step on the 1st beat with their right foot, and on the 5th beat with their left foot.&nbsp; Men always step on the 1st beat with their left foot, and on the 5th beat with their right foot&nbsp; (the only exception to this is during&nbsp; more advanced syncopated open shines).&nbsp; <u>Now drill this for hours, weeks and months</u>:&nbsp; in classes, clubs, at home, even the restroom at work, anywhere. &nbsp; Whether you are doing the basic forward and back step, a side basic, back charges, partner turns or open shines, you must get to the point where the sound of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th, 6th,and 7th beats in the salsa music makes the proper foot go down in the right place, and this must all happen entirely <u>automatically, instinctively, naturally from your heart</u>.&nbsp; No thinking is involved.&nbsp; The man's left foot, and the woman's right foot, must feel the 1st beat, and hit the floor with it.&nbsp; And that goes for all the other beats in the count. &nbsp; You should be able to maintain that timing when listening to the music and dancing with your partner, brushing your teeth, beating an egg, carrying on a conversation, or clapping out a 2/3 or 3/2 clave.&nbsp; In other words, you shouldn't have to think about your feet at all.&nbsp; Again, for how to understand the timing in the music, and how to find the 1st beat of the measure, click on <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Its+All+In+The+Timing/4611441"> Eddie Torres' "It's All In The Timing" </a>. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Why is this important?&nbsp; Because when you are dancing to a great song with your partner, doing cross body leads, complicated turns, shines, and interacting with your partner and moving to the phrasing of the music, there is no time to be thinking about what beat and what foot you should be on.&nbsp; The count and the feet must be so much a natural part of your relationship to the music, that it just feels right.&nbsp; For example, if you are a man leading a double touch-and-go turn, followed by your own single left turn, it must be automatic to start your partner's turn on the 1, while stepping with your left foot, and your own turn on the 5, while stepping on your right foot.&nbsp; And for the woman, it must be automatic to be stepping on your right foot on the 1 at the beginning of that double turn, after setting up with your left foot on 7, and be stepping back on 6 with your right foot when you come out of it.&nbsp; There is no time to be thinking, or to be confused, about what timing one is on.&nbsp; You must have drilled it until it has become automatic and natural.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">When you have achieved this level of mastery of dancing On 2, it now begins to be possible to feel and understand the complex relationship of the dance to the rhythms in the music.&nbsp; Notice that one can become an intermediate or advanced On 2 dancer without any specific discussion or focus on the clave, cowbells, congas/tumbao, etc.&nbsp; That is how we are taught here in New York, including our finest performers who tour internationally representing the New York ON 2 timing and style. &nbsp; The reason this is possible is that the 1, 2, 3,&nbsp; 5, 6, 7 timing, and breaks on 2 and 6, are designed around the clave and conga-tumbao sounds and rhythms, so without mentioning them, you are already dancing to them.&nbsp; And that is why I say above: &nbsp; "<u>Skip the academic discussions, just learn to dance On 2</u>" first, then let's discuss the rhythms and instruments we dance with.&nbsp; Which is what we'll do now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The following discussion of the relationship between the music and our way of dancing refers ONLY to the classic mainstream Caribbean-influenced salsa music that contemporary New York On 2 mambo dancers generally prefer for their style of dancing. &nbsp; It is the music we most frequently hear in our local clubs and studios, and have in our own collections, usually played by the New York, Puerto Rican and Dominican bands.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not refer to other forms and styles of "salsa" music, such as&nbsp; "old school Cuban music", "pop salsa", nor much of the so-called "salsa" that is frequently played elsewhere in the U.S., South America and overseas, cumbias, some charangas, son montunos, and other related types.&nbsp; This mainstream New York-Afro-Caribbean style of music is distinguished by it's much stronger and intense rhythm sounds, played especially by the clave, conga and bongo drums, timbales/cowbells, bass, and also&nbsp; represented in the repetitive beats incorporated into the melody lines.&nbsp; </font></p>

		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><u><strong><a href="" name="Our_Music">Our Music</a> -</strong></u> &nbsp;&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.chriswashburne.com/articles.html">Washburne (1995)</a>, our contemporary New York salsa music and the clave beats originated in African bell and drum rhythms, journeyed to Cuba via slave ships in the 1700's, became blended in the Caribbean, especially in Puerto Rico, with Spanish music, jazz and island dances, and then traveled to New York to become further evolved as it was played in the New York City, especially NewYorican, urban atmosphere of the 1950's and 1960's and adapted to the local dance styles, especially at clubs such as the Palladium.&nbsp; In the 1960's &amp; 1970's, the word "salsa" (which&nbsp; literally means "sauce") was being used by New York's Fania Record Company (associated with the <a href="http://www.oasissalsero.com/tommy/Fania_al.htm">Fania All Stars</a>) as a marketing term to promote the newest version of this music, as was Latin New York Magazine in its articles - see <a href="http://www.salsacrazy.com/salsaroots/salsaorigins.htm">Origins of the Word "Salsa"</a>.&nbsp; And with Cuba's turn to communism under Fidel Castro, and the severing of diplomatic and trade relations between Cuba and the U.S., the ongoing flow and interaction of Cuban and New York musicians and dancers became increasingly limited.&nbsp; As a result, Puerto Rico and New York have emerged since the 1960's as the primary sources and representatives of the contemporary salsa music that we dance to nowadays here in New York City.&nbsp; In spite of the recent fascination about "Cuban music &amp; culture", and the statements by many that New York salsa is Cuban, it should be made clear that we do not dance to "Cuban music" nor do we dance in a Cuban style.&nbsp; We dance a New York style, and we have been doing so for decades.&nbsp; As Johnny Pacheco says:&nbsp; "Salsa is a New York sound".</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Another description of salsa music:&nbsp; "Born in New York City in the 1960s and 70s, salsa is a hybrid of traditional rhythms from Cuba (son ) and Puerto Rico (bomba y plena ), with influences from jazz and R&amp;B.&nbsp; Primarily a dance genre, it is characterized by syncopated arrangements in clave rhythm, Spanish lyrics, and a strong rhythmic pulse punctuated by the trumpet or trombone.&nbsp; The word "salsa" was used as an umbrella term for a variety of different existing rhythms and song styles (guaracha, son, mambo, to name a few), to help market the genre as a uniquely Latino music.&nbsp; Fania Records was the biggest salsa record label, and its artists were truly all-stars.&nbsp; By the late 1970's, salsa had grown far beyond New York, becoming the emblematic music for much of Latin America.&nbsp; Salsa also grew in political and social consciousness but, in the 1980's, sub-genres such as the smooth Salsa Romántica brought the genre great success in Latin America, but didn't appeal as much to young Latinos in New York.&nbsp; The Pop Salsa sound, developed in the early 1990's by producer Sergio George with singers such as Marc Anthony and La India, brought new salsa fans onto the dance floors of New York."&nbsp; From "Latin Music USA" @ <a href="http://www.PBS.org">www.PBS.org</a> .&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">On 2 mambo dancers usually prefer <i><b>classic</b></i> salsa music with a strong danceable <i><b>rhythm</b></i>. &nbsp; The word "classic" does not mean "old";&nbsp; it refers to a certain classic <i><b>style</b></i> of salsa music.&nbsp; The rhythm structure is based on either the <a href="">2/3 or 3/2 son clave</a>, and the sound is one very much associated with Puerto Rican or NewYorican bands, such as El Gran Combo &amp; Tito Puente.&nbsp; This is not to say that bands with other backgrounds or from other locations do not play songs that fit our way of dancing.&nbsp; Some of <a href="">our favorite dance songs</a> come from bands whose roots are far from New York, but it is only when those songs have this "classic New York sound &amp; rhythm" that they are compatible with our On 2 dance timing and style.&nbsp; See <a href="">History &amp; Evolution of our Music</a>.&nbsp; </font></p>

		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><u>The <a href="" name="Clave">Clave</a> - What is "Dancing On Clave"? -</u></strong><b>&nbsp; </b>The clave is traditionally a wooden instrument consisting of 2 sticks which are struck together to make a clicking or tapping sound.&nbsp; Nowadays, sometimes it is a plastic hollow rectangular "box" which may be hand-held or mounted on the drum set - the timbales, cowbell, cymbal, woodblock, etc. &nbsp; And sometimes the clave rhythm sounds come from other sources, such as the drummer tapping the side of a drum, the conga or bongo player's beat, a clave rhythm from the singer, piano or other instrument, etc.&nbsp; In Spanish, the word "clave" means a "key", like a "key word" or the "key to a code".&nbsp; In salsa music, the clave rhythm establishes the key or structure of the song.&nbsp; Directly or indirectly, all the other instruments and the singers in the band are guided and structured by the clave rhythms.&nbsp; While it cannot always be heard in some salsa music, the clave's beat always underlies the rhythmic structure of good salsa.&nbsp; While there are various clave rhythm patterns, the "Son Clave" is the one used in the classic, mainstream New York Caribbean-style salsa music preferred by New Yorkers for On 2 dancing.&nbsp; This clave is played within 2 measures of 4 beats each, a total of 8 beats.&nbsp; But it is only tapped on certain of those 8 beats in the 2 measures.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two son clave rhythm patterns: &nbsp; the 3/2 clave and the 2/3 clave.&nbsp; The 3/2 clave is struck on the following beats:&nbsp; 1, 2 1/2,&nbsp; 4, 6, 7.&nbsp; The 2/3 clave is struck on the following beats:&nbsp; 2, 3,&nbsp; 5, 6 1/2, 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clave creates a complex, syncopated, unevenness in the rhythmic structure that builds a tension in the group of 3 taps, and then releases or resolves that tension in the group of 2 taps, once in each of the 2 measures.&nbsp; It does this by going against, and then rejoining, the regular 8 beats, a little like one instrument playing in 4/4 time, and another playing in 3/4 time simultaneously.&nbsp; This syncopation fascinates and inspires those more experienced On 2 dancers who are particularly in tune to the music, and affects the way they feel and move when they have reached the level of the dance where they are truly "dancing in the music".&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">You may have heard the expression <b>"Dancing on Clave"</b> to describe New York On 2 mambo.&nbsp; This needs some clarification.&nbsp; Actually, <u>this is a loose expression</u> to mean that the clave contributes to the 8 beat rhythmic structure of salsa, and also affects how we feel and move to the music.&nbsp; But <u>we do not literally step to ALL the beats that the clave instrument taps out</u>.&nbsp; For example, the 2/3 clave instrument taps out 2, 3, 5, 6 1/2, 8, while we step on 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.&nbsp; So we are only stepping on the 2, 3 and 5 taps of the 2/3 clave.&nbsp; And the 3/2 clave taps out 1, 2 1/2, 4, 6, 7, while we step on 1, 2, 3,&nbsp; 5, 6, 7.&nbsp; So we only step on the 1, 6, and 7 of the 3/2 clave.&nbsp; As an example of how the clave makes us feel and move, we break on 2 and 6, but the 6 break feels much more emphatic and part of the body than does the 2 break when we are dancing to a song with a 3/2 clave, because the 6 break is "On Clave", at least when it's audible in the music.&nbsp; In contrast, when the song we are dancing to has a clear 2/3 clave structure, the 2 break feels stronger than the 6 break.&nbsp; Many intermediate and advanced On 2 dancers feel this difference, particularly those who are closely attuned to the music.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The clave always has one measure with 2 beats, and one measure with 3 beats.&nbsp; The 2/3 clave has 2 beats in the first measure, and 3 beats in the second measure.&nbsp; The 3/2 clave has 3 beats in the first measure, and 2 beats in the second measure.&nbsp; It is in the nature of the clave rhythmic structure that the 2 beats always stand out more emphatically than the 3 beats.&nbsp; That is, they feel stronger in the rhythm.&nbsp; Partly this is because the 2 beats resolve the syncopated unevenness or tension of the 3 beats.&nbsp; When we are breaking on 2 and 6, we are actually changing our body direction in conjunction with the strongest rhythmic emphasis in the clave's beat.&nbsp; So although we don't literally step on every clave beat, we do make a major body movement (a change of direction) on the major beat of the clave, the 2 beat which resolves the tension.&nbsp; <u>It is in this sense that we "dance on clave".&nbsp;</u> This style of dancing accents the clave's emphasis on the 2&nbsp; in the way we move our bodies in the dance.&nbsp; Other timings, such as breaking on 1 or 3, do not accent the clave's emphasis on the 2 in this way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are other uses of the word "clave" you may hear.&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; "Finding the clave" - referring to when we take our first step, on the 1:&nbsp; "finding the clave" in this usage means finding the first beat of the 8 beat measure. &nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Also, you may hear someone describe a DJ as "mixing the songs on the clave" - This usage means going from one salsa song to the next keeping the tempo/timing of the 8 beats.&nbsp; Both of these uses of the "the clave" have to do with the regular 8 beats, and do not literally refer to the rhythms created by the tapping of the clave instrument.&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Finally, you may hear the expression "changing the clave", referring to when a song restarts the count after only 4 beats instead of 8 beats.&nbsp; When this happens, the dancer is now off-timing since we dance to an 8 beat count.&nbsp; More advanced dancers who feel this "clave change" will do a "transition step" which adjusts their timing to the new count in the music.</font></p>

		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><u><strong>The <a href="" name="Downbeats">Downbeats</a> -</strong></u> &nbsp; An important feature of New York "On 2" mambo is that we begin most of our moves, turns and shines on the 1st and 5th beats of the measure, the downbeats.&nbsp; For some help with finding the 1st &amp; other beats, see <a href="magazine/articles/finding_clave.htm">Manny Siverio's Article</a> article on how to find the beginning of the salsa measure, and also his review of <a href="magazine/articles/review_aotc_counting_cd.htm">Mike Bello's Practice &amp; Counting CD</a>&nbsp; which includes learning to count the beats in the salsa music). &nbsp;See also <a href="">Jai &amp; Candy's Timing &amp; Speed Instructional CD</a>.&nbsp; For example, the cross body lead begins on 1 when the lady is already stepping forward with her right foot. The ladies' turns are usually begun on 1, and the man's turns are often begun on 5. Shines also usually begin on 1.&nbsp;<br />
		<br />
		The 1 is the beginning of the 8 beats of the salsa measure (as noted above, it's actually 2 measures of 4 beats each). There is a strong "downbeat" or "emphasis" in most kinds of music on the 1, including salsa.&nbsp; It is the strongest feeling beat of the measure. That is when a dancer feels the "thrust" or "power" of the rhythm. There is another downbeat, somewhat less strong, on the 5th beat of the measure (the beginning of the 2nd 4 beat measure), when the man often begins his turns. The 1 and the 5 are the strongest rhythmic points in the salsa music, and that is where we begin most of our moves when we dance On 2. </font></p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><u>The <a href="" name="Tumbao">Tumbao</a></u> -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The tumbao refers to the rhythms accented by the conga drum player in mainstream classic salsa music. &nbsp; Specifically, the conga is struck with 2 quick beats and then a 3rd "slap", usually on the outer edge or rim of the drum, in the pattern of quick-quick-slow.&nbsp; Sometimes this is audible in both 4 beat measures, and sometimes only in the first measure.&nbsp; The 2 quick beats are on "8 and..."&nbsp; (actually, 8 and 8 1/2), and on "4 and ..."&nbsp; (actually, 4 and 4 1/2).&nbsp; These 2 quick beats serve as a lead-in to the 1st and 5th beats of the measure, the 2 heavy downbeats that we step on when dancing On 2.&nbsp; In fact, when the 2 quick beats of the tumbao are very clear, they have the effect of "rushing us" into the 1 and 5 steps, making us hit them more emphatically and, sometimes, slightly early, which gives our style of dancing a snap and quickness in the look and feel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Sometimes the "slap", or the "slow" hit of the tumbao is not audible.&nbsp; But when it can be heard, it is often the heavier and more emphatic sound coming from the conga drum.&nbsp; That sound comes on the 2nd beat of the measure.&nbsp; This means that if the tumbao sound can be heard during both 4 beat measures making up the 8 beats we dance to, then the strongest points of emphasis are on the 2nd and 6th beats, which is where we "break", or change our body movement direction, when we dance On 2.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><br />
		<br />
		<font face="Arial"><u><strong><a href="" name="We_Start">We Start</a> On The Major Downbeat, And We Break On The Clave And The Tumbao</strong> <strong>-</strong></u> &nbsp; When <a href="magazine/instructors/eddie_torres.htm">Eddie Torres</a> says that this On 2 timing and style of mambo dancing "logically fits the rhythm of salsa music", he is referring to the fact that the strongest beats in the rhythm, the 1st and 5th beats, are where we begin our moves: &nbsp; we begin our basic step, our cross-body-lead, our turn patterns, our shines. &nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the beats with the greatest rhythmic thrust (1 and 5) are what power the "On 2" dancer's moves. The greatest "push" or "action" in the music's rhythm (the 1 and 5 downbeats) empower the greatest "action" in the dancer's body (the initiation of a move).&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In addition, as noted above, we do our 2 strong body motions, the 2 and 6 breaks (change of body direction),&nbsp; on the major rhythmic beats of the clave, and the strongest sounds of the conga drum, the 2 and 6. &nbsp; So in all three ways (the strongest downbeats, the clave and the tumbao),&nbsp; this particular mambo dance style and timing expresses in its <u>strongest body movements</u> what the structure of salsa music expresses in its <u>strongest rhythms</u>.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">We start on 1, we break on 2:&nbsp; This distinguishes standard New York On 2 timing from those which break on 1, 3, etc., and those which don't begin their moves on the 1st beat, such as timings where the dancers step on 2, 3, 4, and 6, 7, 8, for example Razz M' Tazz and some Palladium, ballroom and international styles.&nbsp; <u>Cuban Pete's Personal Opinion</u> -&nbsp; Quoting Fernando Lamadrid,&nbsp; "Cuban Pete, one of the greatest dancers of the Palladium era once explained it&nbsp; like this:&nbsp; "Dancing "On 1" is dancing <u>"TO"</u> the music.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dancing "On 2" is dancing <u>"IN"</u> the music.&nbsp; And at a panel discussion at the World Salsa Congress, he said&nbsp; "....Dancing "On 1" is like dancing to the <u>melody</u> of the music, while dancing "On 2" is like dancing in the <u>rhythm</u> of the music." &nbsp;&nbsp; It might actually be more precise to say &nbsp; ".......dancing "On 2" is like dancing in the <u>rhythm</u> of the clave's tension-resolving and dominant 2 beat".&nbsp; While these statements are <u>only an opinion</u>, they are not uncommon.&nbsp; They do reflect many On 2 dancers' belief and feeling, especially those who danced on another timing previously, that this particular method connects them more to the rhythmic percussive elements in the salsa music.&nbsp; And, by the way, most of us also love the melody and the words in the songs, not just the rhythm.&nbsp; The major point here is that the New York On 2 timing connects very well to the rhythmic structure of classic salsa music.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Please note, however, as mentioned in our <a href="guide/description_newsletter.htm">Welcome &amp; Introduction</a> to this web site, that nothing here is meant to suggest that different ways of dancing to salsa music are any less legitimate or less enjoyable. No offense is meant, and none should be taken.&nbsp; There is no right or wrong way to dance.&nbsp; One can dance in many ways, and in connection with many different aspects of the music:&nbsp; rhythm, melody, mood, meaning of the words, tempo, harmony, intensity, etc.&nbsp; What matters most is what each dancer prefers.....and that they don't smash into their neighbors on the dance floor.</font></p>
